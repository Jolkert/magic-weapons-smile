Wondrous Item
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, rare*

Inside this heavy cloth bag are 3d4 dry beans. The bag weighs 1/2 pound plus 1/4 pound for each bean it contains.

If you dump the bag's contents out on the ground, they explode in a 10-foot radius, extending from the beans. Each creature in the area, including you, must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

## Banner of the Krig Rune
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Storm King's Thunder

*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

Crafted from a thick, red fabric, this banner measures 5 feet high and 3 feet wide. The krig (war) rune is displayed on the fabric with round, metal plates sewn into it. It can be attached to a 10-foot pole to serve as a standard. Furling or unfurling the banner requires an action. The banner has the following properties.

***Mark of Courage.*** As a bonus action, you can touch the unfurled banner and cause it to emanate courage. You and your allies are immune to the frightened condition while within 20 feet of it. This benefit lasts for 10 minutes or until the banner is furled. Once you use this property, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

***Sentinel Standard.*** You can see invisible creatures while they are within 20 feet of the unfurled banner and within your line of sight.

***Standard's Shield.*** As a bonus action, you can touch the unfurled banner and invoke this power. Any ranged attack roll that targets you or an ally of yours has disadvantage if the target is within 20 feet of the unfurled banner. This benefit lasts for 1 minute or until the banner is furled. Once you use this property, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

***Gift of Battle.*** You can transfer the banner's magic to a place by tracing the krig rune on the ground with your finger. The point where you trace it becomes the center of a spherical area of magic that has a 500-foot radius and that is fixed to the place. The transfer takes 8 hours of work that requires the banner to be within 5 feet of you and during which you choose creatures, creature types, or both that will benefit from the magic. At the end, the banner is destroyed, and the area gains the following property:

* While in the 500-foot-radius sphere, the creatures you chose during the transfer process are immune to the frightened condition and gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and AC.

## Barrier Tattoo
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything

*Wondrous item (tattoo), rarity varies (requires attunement)*

**Tattoo Attunement.** To attune to this item, you hold the needle to your skin where you want the tattoo to appear, pressing the needle there throughout the attunement process. When the attunement is complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the skin.

If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo vanishes, and the needle reappears in your space.

**Protection.** While you aren't wearing armor, the tattoo grants you an Armor Class depending on the tattoo's rarity, as shown below. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.

| Rarity  |                     AC                     |
|---------|--------------------------------------------|
|Uncommon |        12 + your Dexterity modifier        |
|  Rare   |15 + your Dexterity modifier (maximum of +2)|

Additionally, the shield has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you are holding the shield and push a creature within your reach at least 5 feet away, you can expend 1 charge to push that creature an additional 10 feet, knock it prone, or both.

Wondrous Item
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, rare*

This small black sphere measures 3/4 of an inch in diameter and weighs an ounce. Typically, 1d4 + 4 *beads of force* are found together.

You can use an action to throw the bead up to 60 feet. The bead explodes on impact and is destroyed. Each creature within a 10-foot radius of where the bead landed must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 5d4 force damage. A sphere of transparent force then encloses the area for 1 minute. Any creature that failed the save and is completely within the area is trapped inside this sphere. Creatures that succeeded on the save, or are partially within the area, are pushed away from the center of the sphere until they are no longer inside it. Only breathable air can pass through the sphere's wall. No attack or other effect can.

An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere's wall, moving the sphere up to half the creature's walking speed. The sphere can be picked up, and its magic causes it to weigh only 1 pound, regardless of the weight of creatures inside.

*Weapon (any axe), rare (requires attunement)*

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, while you are attuned to this weapon, your hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained.

You also have disadvantage on attack rolls with weapons other than this one, unless no foe is within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear.

Whenever a hostile creature damages you while the axe is in your possession, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or go berserk. While berserk, you must use your action each round to attack the creature nearest to you with the axe. If you can make extra attacks as part of the Attack action, you use those extra attacks, moving to attack the next nearest creature after you fell your current target. If you have multiple possible targets, you attack one at random. You are berserk until you start your turn with no creatures within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear.

You sense the distance and direction of the creature relative to your location. The creature is either the one whose blood is in the item or a blood relative.

This item is made from a large diamond worth at least 5,000 gp. When the blood of a creature is poured onto it during the creation process, the blood seeps into the heart of the gem. If the gem is destroyed, the blood evaporates and is gone forever. A vengeful being might use a *Blod Stone* to hunt down an entire bloodline.

Once the targeted is affected, you do not need to hold the other end of the bridle to command it. With a successful saving throw, the target becomes immune to the bridle’s power until the next dawn.

As an action, you can blow the petals from the rose to produce a 20-foot cone of acid, lightning, poisonous gas, fire, or cold, as dictated by the rose's damage type. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 3d10 damage of the appropriate type on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The point where you trace it becomes the center of a spherical area of magic that has a 100-foot radius and that is fixed to the place. The transfer takes 8 hours of work that requires the claw to be within 5 feet of you. At the end, the claw is destroyed, and the area gains the following property:

## Daern's Instant Fortress
Wondrous Item
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, rare*

You can use an action to place this 1-inch metal cube on the ground and speak its command word. The cube rapidly grows into a fortress that remains until you use an action to speak the command word that dismisses it, which works only if the fortress is empty.

The fortress is a square tower, 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop it. Its interior is divided into two floors, with a ladder running along one wall to connect them. The ladder ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When activated, the tower has a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command, which you can speak as a bonus action. It is immune to the [Knock](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:knock) spell and similar magic, such as that of a [Chime of Opening](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:chime-of-opening).

Each creature in the area where the fortress appears must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In either case, the creature is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the fortress. Objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried take this damage and are pushed automatically.

The tower is made of adamantine, and its magic prevents it from being tipped over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have 100 hit points, immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and resistance to all other damage. Only a [Wish](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:wish) spell can repair the fortress (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th level or lower). Each casting of wish causes the roof, the door, or one wall to regain 50 hit points.

The armor can be worn under normal clothes, and it doesn’t impede bodily functions. Once you put it on, it can’t be removed unless you choose to do so or you die, at which point the pot reappears and the ichor flows back into it.

While wearing the armor, you have resistance to poison damage. The armor also doesn’t impose disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

As a bonus action, you can speak the command word to cause the flail to emanate a thin cloud of incense out to 10 feet for 1 minute. At the start of each of your turns, you and any other creatures in the incense each regain 1d4 hit points. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.

Wondrous Item
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, rare*

You can use an action to place these shackles on an incapacitated creature. The shackles adjust to fit a creature of Small to Large size. In addition to serving as mundane manacles, the shackles prevent a creature bound by them from using any method of extradimensional movement, including teleportation or travel to a different plane of existence. They don't prevent the creature from passing-through an interdimensional portal.

You and any creature you designate when you use the shackles can use an action to remove them. Once every 30 days, the bound creature can make a DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check. On a success, the creature breaks free and destroys the shackles.

## Docent
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Eberron - Rising from the Last War

*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a warforged)*

A *docent* is a small metal sphere, about 2 inches across, studded with dragonshards. To attune to a *docent*, you must embed the item somewhere on your body, such as your chest or your eye socket.

***Sentience.*** A docent is a sentient item of any alignment with an Intelligence of 16, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 14. It perceives the world through your senses. It communicates telepathically with you and can speak, read, and understand any language it knows (see "Random Properties" below).

***Life Support.*** Whenever you end your turn with 0 hit points, the docent can make a Wisdom (Medicine) check with a +6 bonus. If this check succeeds, the docent stabilizes you.

***Random Properties.*** A *docent* has the following properties:

* ***Languages.*** The *docent* knows Common, Giant, and 1d4 additional languages chosen by the DM. If a *docent* knows fewer than six languages, it can learn a new language after it hears or reads the language through your senses.

The docent decides when to cast the spell.

***Personality.*** A *docent* is designed to advise and assist the warforged it's attached to. One of the simple functions of a *docent* is to serve as a translator. The *docent's* properties are under its control, and if you have a bad relationship with your *docent*, it might refuse to assist you.

Wondrous Item
Source - Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage

*Wondrous Item, Rare*

This twelve-sided metal die is 12 inches across and bears the numbers 1 through 12 engraved on its pentagonal sides. The dodecahedron contains arcane clockwork mechanisms that whir and click whenever the die is cast.  
The dodecahedron can be hurled up to 60 feet as an action: A random magical effect occurs when the die comes to a rest after rolling across the ground for at least 10 feet. If an effect requires a target and no eligible target is within range, nothing happens. Spells cast by the dodecahedron require no components. Roll a d12 and consult the following table to determine the effect:

| D12 |                                                                                                             Effect                                                                                                              |

| 3-4 |                                                                    The dodecahedron casts light on itself. The effect lasts until a creature touches the die                                                                    |
| 5-6 |                   The dodecahedron casts [Ray of Frost](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:ray-of-frost) (+5 to hit) targeting a random creature within 60 feet that doesn't have total cover against the attack.                   |

|11-12|                                                                The next creature to touch the dodecahedron gains 1d10 temporary hit points that last for 1 hour.                                                                |

Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: The Book of Many Things

*Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement)*

This marble-size crystal sphere glows with extraplanar energy.

As part of attuning to this item, you press the crystal sphere to the hilt of a nonmagical melee weapon of your choice, magically attaching the sphere to the weapon. The weapon becomes a magic weapon with a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls. While wielding this weapon, you gain the following benefits:

Dimensional Anchor. You have advantage on saving throws against spells or effects that would send you to an extradimensional space, a demiplane, or another plane of existence against your will.

Isolating Smite. When you hit a creature with this weapon, you can force the creature to make a DC 16 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is banished to a harmless demiplane until the end of its next turn. When the banished creature returns, it reappears in the space it left or the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. Once this property is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

When you end your attunement to the sphere, the sphere harmlessly detaches from the weapon, and the weapon reverts to a nonmagical piece of equipment.

Gem. Whenever you use a spell slot to cast a spell, you can immediately teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 15 feet of you.

Metallic. When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes a saving throw, you can use your reaction to give that creature advantage on the saving throw.

Once the item is used to cast a given spell, it can’t be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells are determined by the family of the dragon in whose hoard it became Wakened.

A *Figurine of Wondrous Power* is a statuette of a beast small enough to fit in a pocket. If you use an action to speak the command word and throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the figurine becomes a living creature. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn't become a creature.

The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions. See the *Monster Manuel* for the creature's statistics.

The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine's description.

***Bronze Griffon (Rare).*** This bronze statuette is of a griffon rampant. It can become a **griffon** for up to 6 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 5 days have passed.

***Ebony Fly (Rare).*** This ebony statuette is carved in the likeness of a horsefly. It can become a **giant fly** for up to 12 hours and can be ridden as a mount. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed.

***Golden Lions (Rare).*** These gold statuettes of lions are always created in pairs. You can use one figurine or both simultaneously. Each can become a **lion** for up to 1 hour. Once a lion has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

***Ivory Goats (Rare).*** These ivory statuettes of goats are always created in sets of three. Each goat looks unique and functions differently from the others. Their properties are as follows

* The *goat of traveling* can become a **Large goat** with the same statistics as a **riding horse**. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in beast form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can't be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all its charges.

* The *goat of travail* becomes a **giant goat** for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 30 days have passed.

* The *goat of terror* becomes a **giant goat** for up to 3 hours. The goat can't attack, but you can remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes a *+1 lance*, and the other becomes a *+2 longsword*. Removing a horn requires an action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form. In addition, the goat radiates a 30-foot-radius aura of terror while you are riding it. Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the goat for 1 minute, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it successfully saves against the effect, a creature is immune to the goat's aura for the net 24 hours. Once the figurine has been used, it can't be used again until 15 days have passed.

***Marble Elephant (Rare).*** This marble statuette is about 4 inches high and long. It can become an **elephant** for up to 24 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

***Obsidian Steed (Very Rare).*** This polished obsidian horse can become a **nightmare** for up to 24 hours. The nightmare fights only to defend itself. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 5 days have passed.

If you have a good alignment, the figurine has a 10 percent chance each time you use it to ignore your orders, including a command to revert to figurine form. If you mount the nightmare while it is ignoring your orders, you and the nightmare are instantly transported to a random location on the plane of Hades, where the nightmare reverts to figurine form.

***Onyx Dog (Rare).*** This onyx statuette of a dog can become a **mastiff** for up to 6 hours. The mastiff has an Intelligence of 8 and can speak Common. It also has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet and can see invisible creatures and objects within that range. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

***Serpentine Owl (Rare).*** This serpentine statuette of an owl can become a **giant owl** for up to 8 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed. The owl can telepathically communicate with you at any range if you and it are on the same plane of existence.

***Silver Raven (Uncommon).*** This silver statuette of a raven can become a **raven** for up to 12 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed. While in raven form, the figurine allows you to cast the [Animal Messenger](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:animal-messenger) spell on it at will.

In addition, the following *Figurine of Wondrous Power* was added in *Fizban's Treasury of Dragons:*

***Gold Canary (Legendary)***  
*Giant Canary Form.* The figurine becomes a giant canary (see the accompanying stat block) for up to 8 hours and can be ridden as a mount. Once the figurine has become a giant canary, it can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.  
*Gold Dragon Form.* While you are missing half or more of your hit points, you can speak a different command word and the figurine becomes an adult gold dragon for up to 1 hour. The dragon can’t use any legendary actions or lair actions. Once the figurine has become an adult gold dragon, it can’t be used this way again until 1 year has passed.

These flames shed bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. While the sword is ablaze, it deals an extra 2d6 fire damage to any target it hits.

Wondrous Item
Source: Mythic Odysseys of Theros

*Wondrous item, rare*

The chariot's riders and creatures pulling the chariot gain a +1 bonus to their AC.

If this magic chariot is pulled by one or more flying creatures, it too can fly.

**Chariots**

*Chariots and the creatures pulling them work like controlled mounts, as described in the mounted combat rules in the* Player's Handbook*, but with the following differences:*

* *Mounting or dismounting a chariot costs you 5 feet of movement, rather than a number of feet equal to half your speed.*
* *Being mounted on a chariot grants you half cover.*
* *A chariot's speed is equal to the speed of the slowest creature pulling it.*
* *If multiple creatures are pulling the chariot, they all act on the same initiative, and they must take the same action on their turn.*

## Folding Boat
Wondrous Item
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, rare*

This object appears as a wooden box that measures 12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 6 inches deep. It weighs 4 pounds and floats. It can be opened to store items inside. This item also has three command words, each requiring you to use an action to speak it.

One command word causes the box to unfold into a boat 10 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 2 feet deep. The boat has one pair of oars, an anchor, a mast, and a lateen sail. The boat can hold up to four Medium creatures comfortably.

The second command word causes the box to unfold into a ship 24 feet long, 8 feet wide; and 6 feet deep. The ship has a deck, rowing seats, five sets of oars, a steering oar, an anchor, a deck cabin, and a mast with a square sail. The ship can hold fifteen Medium creatures comfortably.

When the box becomes a vessel, its weight becomes that of a normal vessel its size, and anything that was stored in the box remains in the boat.

The third command word causes the *folding boat* to fold back into a box, provided that no creatures are aboard. Any objects in the vessel that can't fit inside the box remain outside the box as it folds. Any objects in the vessel that can fit inside the box do so.

## Fulminating Treatise
Wondrous Item (Attuned)

It functions as a spellbook for you.

While you are holding the book, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

The book has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:

* If you spend 1 minute studying the book, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book. The new spell must be of the evocation school.
* When one creature you can see takes damage from an evocation spell you cast, you can use your reaction and expend 1 charge to deal an extra 2d6 force damage to the creature and knock the creature prone if it is Large or smaller.

## Galder's Bubble Pipe
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Lost Laboratory of Kwalish

*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

This finely carved pipe blows odorless bubbles instead of smoke when used. The pipe has 3 charges, and it regains all spent charges daily at dawn. While you hold the pipe, you can expend charges to gain access to the following properties:

## Gambler's Blade
Weapon (Attuned)
Source: Lost Laboratory of Kwalish

*Weapon (any sword), rare (requires attunement)*

Choose a magical bonus of +1 to +3. This sword gains that bonus to its attack and damage rolls. For each point of bonus you choose for the sword, you take a corresponding penalty (−1 to −3) to your death saving throws. You can change this magical bonus each day at dawn.

***Curse.*** This weapon is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. Until the curse is broken with a [Remove Curse](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:remove-curse) spell or similar magic, you are unwilling to part with the weapon.

## Gauntlets of Flaming Fury
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Baldur's Gate - Descent into Avernus

*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

While you wear both of these steel gauntlets, any nonmagical weapon you grasp with either gauntlet is treated as a magic weapon. As a bonus action, you can use the gauntlets to cause magical flames to envelop one or two melee weapons in your grasp. Each flaming weapon deals an extra 1d6 fire damage on a hit. The flames last until you sheath or let go of either weapon. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Gavel of the Venn Rune
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Storm King's Thunder

*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

This wooden gavel is small by giant reckoning but nearly the size of a warhammer in human hands. The venn (friend) rune is inscribed in mithral in the base of the haft. Among giants, this item is used as part of rituals to resolve disputes. The gavel has the following properties.

***Arbiter's Shield.*** At the start of every combat, attack rolls against you have disadvantage before the start of your first turn, provided that the gavel is on your person.

***Bond of Amity.*** As an action, you can use the gavel to strike a point on a hard surface. The first time in the next minute that a creature within 60 feet of that point deals damage to another creature with an attack that hits, the attacker takes psychic damage equal to half the damage it dealt to the target. Once you use this property, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

***Gift of Truth.*** You can transfer the gavel's magic to a place by tracing the venn rune on the ground with your finger. The point where you trace it becomes the center of a spherical area of magic that has a 30-foot radius and that is fixed to the place. The transfer takes 8 hours of work that requires the gavel to be within 5 feet of you. At the end, the gavel is destroyed, and the area gains the following property:

* Whenever a creature utters a lie while within the 30-foot-radius sphere, that creature takes 5 psychic damage and flinches visibly.

## Gem of Seeing

## Ghost Lantern
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Tomb of Annihilation

*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

A restless spirit is trapped inside this lantern. While holding the lantern, you can command the spirit as a bonus action to shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.

While holding the lantern, you can use an action to order the spirit to leave the lantern and duplicate the effect of the [Mage Hand](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:mage-hand) spell. The spirit returns to the lantern when the spell ends.

If you fall unconscious within 10 feet of the lantern, the spirit emerges from it, magically stabilizes you with a touch, and then quickly returns to the lantern.

The spirit is bound to the lantern and can't be harmed, turned, or raised from the dead. Casting a [Dispel Evil and Good](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:dispel-evil-and-good) spell on the lantern releases the spirit to the afterlife and renders the lantern nonmagical.

The illusory appearance last until you use this property again or remove the armor.

## Glimmering Moonbow

When you hit with a ranged attack roll using this magic bow, the target takes an extra 1d6 radiant damage. If you load no ammunition in the weapon, it produces its own, automatically creating one piece of magic ammunition when you make a ranged attack with it. The ammunition created by the bow vanishes the instant after it hits or misses a target.

While wielding this magic bow, you can use a bonus action to enter a semi-incorporeal state until the start of your next turn. While semi-incorporeal, you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. Once this bonus action is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

## Glowrune Pigment
Wondrous Item
Source: Bigby Presents - Glory of the Giants

*Wondrous Item, Rare*

This set of 1d4 + 2 small paint pots contains pigments mixed from crushed luminescent gemstones. This magical paint bestows temporary magical gifts on creatures with runes drawn on their skin with this paint.

One paint pot contains enough pigment to paint one rune. A creature can spend 10 minutes to paint one of the following runes onto itself or another creature:

**Journey Rune.** Difficult terrain doesn’t cost the painted creature extra movement.

**Life Rune.** The painted creature gains 10 temporary hit points and has advantage on death saving throws.

**Light Rune.** The painted creature gains *darkvision* to a range of 30 feet. If the painted creature already has *darkvision* from another source, the range of its *darkvision* increases by 30 feet.

**Mountain Rune.** The painted creature is immune to being knocked prone and has advantage on Strength and Constitution saving throws.

**Shield Rune.** The painted creature has advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that deal damage.

A creature can benefit from only one painted rune at a time, so a new rune painted on a creature has no effect unless the old one is removed first. The rune’s benefits last for 8 hours or until the painted creature uses its action to wipe away the rune.

## Grasping Whip
Weapon
Source: The Book of Many Things

*Weapon (whip), rare*

## Guild Keyrune
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica

*Wondrous item, rarity by keyrune (requires attunement by a member of the relevant guild)*

Associated with a particular guild, a *guild keyrune* is a ceremonial, stylized key, about 1 foot long, made from carved stone. Not a literal key, the item is a badge of authority that gives its bearer access to privileged places in its guild's headquarters and outposts. At the DM's discretion, a character might be given a keyrune upon attaining a renown score of 25 in their guild.

When you use an action to speak the item's command word and place the keyrune on the ground in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, the keyrune transforms into a creature. If there isn't enough space for the creature, the keyrune doesn't transform. See the *Monster Manual* for the creature's stat block — the name of which is given in bold in the keyrune's description — unless you're directed to chapter 6 of this book instead.

The creature is friendly to you, your companions, and other members of your guild (unless those guild members are hostile to you). It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature takes the Dodge action and moves to avoid danger.

The creature exists for a duration specific to each keyrune. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its keyrune form. It reverts early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature reverts to its keyrune form, it can't transform again until 36 hours have passed.

***Azorius Keyrune (Rare).*** This keyrune is carved from white marble and lapis lazuli to resemble a noble bird of prey. It can become a **giant eagle** for up to 1 hour. While the transformed eagle is within l mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. As an action, you can see through the eagle's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, and you gain the benefit of its keen sight. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.

***Boros Keyrune (Rare).*** Carved from red sandstone with white granite elements to resemble a member of the Boros Legion, this keyrune can become a **veteran** (human) for up to 8 hours. In addition to fighting on your behalf, this veteran cheerfully offers tactical advice, which is usually sound. Anyone who talks with the transformed keyrune or examines it closely can easily recognize that it is an artificial human.

***Dimir Keyrune (Very Rare).*** This keyrune, carved from black stone accented with steel, resembles a stylized horror. On command, it transforms into an **intellect devourer** that resembles the Dimir guild symbol, with six bladelike legs. The creature exists for up to 24 hours. During that time, it pursues only a single mission you give it — usually an assignment to take over someone's body, either to impersonate that person for a brief time or to extract secrets from their mind. When the mission is complete, the creature returns to you, reports its success, and reverts to its keyrune form.

***Golgari Keyrune (Very Rare).*** Made from deep green jade with black veins, this keyrune has an insectile shape. It can transform into a **giant scorpion** for up to 6 hours. The scorpion has an Intelligence of 4 and can communicate with you telepathically while it is within 60 feet of you, though its messages are largely limited to describing the passage of potential prey.

***Gruul Keyrune (Rare).*** This crude keyrune is cobbled together from bits of rubble, broken glass, bone, and animal hair. One end resembles a horned beast. On command, the keyrune transforms into a ceratok, a horned creature much like a **rhinoceros** (and with the same statistics). It remains in its ceratok form for 1 hour.

***Izzet Keyrune (Rare).*** Formed of carved and polished red and blue stone, the keyrune includes bits of cable and wire. One end resembles a humanlike head, suggesting the jagged elemental form of the **galvanice weird** (see chapter 6 for the stat block) that it can become for a duration of 3 hours. In this form, it will serve you as a bodyguard, lift and carry things for you, act as a test subject for your experiments, or aid you in any other way that its capabilities allow.

***Orzhov Keyrune (Rare).*** This keyrune is carved from white marble with veins of black. The end is shaped like a thrull's head, with a gold faceplate affixed. On command, the keyrune transforms into a **winged thrull** (see chapter 6 for the stat block) for up to 2 hours. If you don't come from an Orzhov oligarch family, it serves you grudgingly, clownishly aping your movements and mannerisms while carrying out your orders.

***Rakdos Keyrune (Uncommon).*** This dark granite keyrune is marbled with scarlet veins and carved with the leering visage of a mischievous demon. When activated, it transforms into a **cackler** (see chapter 6 for the stat block) for up to 1 hour.

***Selesnya Keyrune (Rare).*** Carved from white and green marble in the shape of a wolf's head, this keyrune transforms into a **dire wolf**. The wolf persists for 8 hours. Its Intelligence is 6, and it understands Elvish and Sylvan but can't speak those languages. While it is within 1 mile of you. you can communicate with each other telepathically.

***Simic Keyrune (Uncommon).*** This keyrune is assembled from coral, mother-of pearl, and chrome and adorned with the spirals and curves characteristic of Simic ornamentation. The head resembles the shell of a sea creature. On command, the keyrune turns into a **category 1 krasis** (see chapter 6 for the stat block) that has the Grabber and Stabilizing Legs adaptations. The transformation lasts for up to 5 hours.

## Gulthias Staff
Staff (Attuned)
Source: Curse of Strahd

*Staff, rare (requires attunement)*

Made from the branch of a Gulthias tree (see the blights entry in the *Monster Manual*), a Gulthias staff is a spongy, black length of wood. Its evil makes beasts visibly uncomfortable while within 30 feet of it. The staff has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 of its expended charges daily at dusk.

If the staff is broken or burned to ashes, its wood releases a terrible, inhuman scream that can be heard out to a range of 300 feet. All blights that can hear the scream immediately wither and die.

***Vampiric Strike.*** The staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff. On a hit, it deals damage as a normal quarterstaff, and you can expend 1 charge to regain a number of hit points equal to the damage dealt by the weapon. Each time a charge is spent, red blood oozes from the staff's pores, and you must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be afflicted with short-term madness (see "Madness" in chapter 8 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*).

***Blight Bane.*** While you are attuned to the staff, blights and other evil plant creatures don't regard you as hostile unless you harm them.

## Heart Weaver's Primer
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything

*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a wizard)*

This pristine book smells faintly of a random scent you find pleasing. When found, the book contains the following spells: [Antipathy/Sympathy](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:antipathy-sympathy), [Charm Person](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:charm-person), [Dominate Person](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:dominate-person), [Enthrall](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:enthrall), [Hypnotic Pattern](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:hypnotic-pattern), [Modify Memory](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:modify-memory), and [Suggestion](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:suggestion). It functions as a spellbook for you.

While you are holding the book, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

The book has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:

* If you spend 1 minute studying the book, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book. The new spell must be of the enchantment school.
* When you cast an enchantment spell, you can expend 1 charge to impose disadvantage on the first saving throw one target makes against the spell.

## Hell Hound Cloak
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Tales from the Yawning Portal

*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

This dark cloak is made of cured hell hound hide. As an action, you can command the cloak to transform you into a **hell hound** for up to 1 hour. The transformation otherwise functions as the [Polymorph](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:polymorph) spell, but you can use a bonus action to revert to your normal form.

***Curse.*** This cloak is cursed with the essence of a hell hound, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. Until the curse is broken with [Remove Curse](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:remove-curse) or similar magic, you are unwilling to part with the cloak, keeping it within reach at all times.

The sixth time you use the cloak, and each time thereafter, you must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the transformation lasts until dispelled or until you drop to 0 hit points, and you can't willingly return to normal form. If you ever remain in hell hound form for 6 hours, the transformation becomes permanent and you lose your sense of self. All your statistics are then replaced by those of a hell hound. Thereafter, only [Remove Curse](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:remove-curse) or similar magic allows you to regain your identity and return to normal. If you remain in this permanent form for 6 days, only a wish spell can reverse the transformation.

## Helm of Teleportation
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

This helm has 3 charges. While wearing it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cast the [Teleport](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:teleport) spell from it. The helm regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.

## Helm of the Gods
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Mythic Odysseys of Theros

*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

While wearing this helm, you know whether there is a celestial or fiend within 30 feet of you, as well as where the creature is located, provided the creature isn't behind total cover.

Whenever you finish a long rest while wearing the helm, you can pray to one of the gods listed on the Helm of the Gods table and store the listed spell in the helm, replacing any spell that is already stored there. The save DC for the spell is 13.

The helm has 3 charges. To cast a spell from the helm, you must expend 1 charge, and the helm regains 1d3 charges daily at dawn.

## Heward's Handy Haversack
Wondrous Item
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, rare*

This backpack has a central pouch and two side pouches, each of which is an extradimensional space. Each side pouch can hold up to 20 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 2 cubic feet. The large central pouch can hold up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. The backpack always weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its contents.

Placing an object in the haversack follows the normal rules for interacting with objects. Retrieving an item from the haversack requires you to use an action. When you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the item is always magically on top.

The haversack has a few limitations. If it is overloaded, or if a sharp object pierces it or tears it, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an artifact always turns up again somewhere. If the haversack is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, and the haversack must be put right before it can be used again. If a breathing creature is placed within the haversack, the creature can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.

Placing the haversack inside an extradimensional space created by a [Bag of Holding](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:bag-of-holding), [Portable Hole](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:portable-hole), or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10-feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.

## Hook of Fisher's Delight
Wondrous Item
Source: Icewind Dale - Rime of the Frostmaiden

*Wondrous item, rare*

This tiny silver fishhook has a little gold feather attached to it. For it to function, the feathered hook must be tied to the end of a fishing line and immersed in enough water to fill at least a 10-foot cube. At the end of each uninterrupted hour of immersion, roll a d6. On a 6, a floppy, 6-inch-long magical fish appears on the end of the hook. The color and properties of the conjured fish are determined by rolling on the Hook of Fisher's Delight table. Once the hook conjures a fish, it can't do so again until the next dawn.

## Horn of Blasting
Wondrous Item
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, rare*

You can use an action to speak the horn's command word and then blow the horn, which emits a thunderous blast in a 30-foot cone that is audible 600 feet away. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d6 thunder damage and is deafened for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't deafened. Creatures and objects made of glass or crystal have disadvantage on the saving throw and take 10d6 thunder damage instead of 5d6.

Each use of the horn's magic has a 20 percent chance of causing the horn to explode. The explosion deals 10d6 fire damage to the blower and destroys the horn.

## Horn of the Endless Maze
Wondrous Item
Source - Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage

*Wondrous Item, Rare*

You can use an action to blow this horn. In response, 3d4+3 warrior spirits from the Abyss appear within 60 feet of you. They look like Minotaurs and use the statistics of a Berserker. They return to the Abyss after 1 hour or when they drop to 0 hit points. Once you use the horn, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

If you blow the horn without having proficiency with all simple weapons, the summoned berserkers attack you. If you meet the requirement, they are friendly to you and your companions and follow your commands.

## Horn of Valhalla
Wondrous Item
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, rare (silver or brass), very rare (bronze), or legendary (iron)*

You can use an action to blow this horn. In response, warrior spirits from the plane of Ysgard appear within 60 feet of you. These spirits use the berserker statistics from the *Monster Manual*. They return to Ysgard after 1 hour or when they drop to 0 hit points. Once you use the horn, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

Four types of *horn of Valhalla* are known to exist, each made of a different metal. The horn's type determines how many berserkers answer its summons, as well as the requirement for its use. The DM chooses the horn's type or determines it randomly.

|d100 |Horn Type|Berserkers Summoned|            Requirement             |
|-----|---------|-------------------|------------------------------------|
|01-40| Silver  |      2d4 + 2      |                None                |
|41-75|  Brass  |      3d4 + 3      |Proficiency with all simple weapons |
|76-90| Bronze  |      4d4 + 4      | Proficiency with all medium armor  |
|91-00|  Iron   |      5d4 + 5      |Proficiency with all martial weapons|

If you blow the horn without meeting its requirement, the summoned berserkers attack you. If you meet the requirement, they are friendly to you and your companions and follow your commands.

## Horseshoes of Speed
Wondrous Item

*Wondrous item, rare*

These iron horseshoes come in a set of four. While all four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature, they increase the creature's walking speed by 30 feet.

## Iggwylv's Horn
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Quests from the Infinite Staircase

*Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)*

You can use an action to blow this horn to cast one of the following spells from it: [Arms of Hadar](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:arms-of-hadar), [Fog Cloud](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:fog-cloud), [Gust of Wind](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:gust-of-wind), or [Web](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:web). If the spell requires a saving throw, the spell save DC is 13.

Once the horn has been used to cast a spell, it can’t be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn.

## Instrument of the Bards
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement by a bard)*

An *instrument of the bards* is an exquisite example of its kind, superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a legendary bard college. The following table lists the spells common to all instruments, as well as the spells specific to each one and its rarity. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 2d4 psychic damage.

You can use an action to play the instrument and cast one of its spells. Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.

You can play the instrument while casting a spell that causes any of its targets to be charmed on a failed saving throw, thereby imposing disadvantage on the save. This effect applies only if the spell has a somatic or a material component.

|     Instrument     | Rarity  |                                                                                                                                                     Spells                                                                                                                                                     |

## Ioun Stone
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide, Lost Laboratory of Kwalish

*Wondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement)*

An *Ioun stone* is named after Ioun, a god of knowledge and prophecy revered on some worlds. Many types of *Ioun stone* exist, each type a distant combination of shape and color.

When you use an action to toss one of these stones into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance of 1d3 feet and confers a benefit to you. Thereafter, another creature must use an action to grasp or net the stone to separate it from you, either by making a successful attack roll against AC 24 or a successful DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. You can use an action to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect.

A stone has AC 24, 10 hit points, and resistance to all damage. It is considered to be an object that is being worn while it orbits your head.

***Absorption (Very Rare).*** While this pale lavender ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell of 4th level or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you

Once the stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can't cancel it.

***Agility (Very Rare).*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this deep red sphere orbits your head.

***Awareness (Rare).*** You can't be surprised while this dark blue rhomboid orbits your head.

***Fortitude (Very Rare).*** Your Constitution score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pink rhomboid orbits your head.

***Greater Absorption (Legendary).*** While this marbled lavender and green ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell of 8th level or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you.

Once the stone has canceled 50 levels of spells, it burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can't cancel it.

***Insight (Very Rare).*** Your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this incandescent blue sphere orbits your head.

***Intellect (Very Rare).*** Your Intelligence score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled scarlet and blue sphere orbits your head.

***Leadership (Very Rare).*** Your charisma score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled pink and green sphere orbits your head.

***Mastery (Legendary).*** Your proficiency bonus increases by 1 while this pale green prism orbits your head.

***Protection (Rare).*** You gain a +1 bonus to AC while this dusty rose prism orbits your head.

***Regeneration (Legendary).*** You regain 15 hit points at the end of each hour this pearly white spindle orbits your head, provided that you have at least 1 hit point.

***Reserve (Rare).*** This vibrant purple prism stores spells cast into it, holding them until you use them. The stone can store up to 3 levels worth of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d4-1 levels of stored spells chosen by the DM.

Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 3rd level into the stone by touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the stone. If the stone can't hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.

While this stone orbits your head, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the stone is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.

***Strength (Very Rare).*** Your Strength score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pale blue rhomboid orbits your head.

***Sustenance (Rare).*** You don't need to eat or drink while this clear spindle orbits your head.

In addition, the following *Ioun Stones* were introduced in the adventure *Lost Laboratory of Kwalish*:

***Historical Knowledge (Rare)*** You gain proficiency in the History skill, or a +1 bonus to checks with that skill if already proficient, while this polished, steely sphere orbits your head.

***Language Knowledge (Rare)*** You are fluent in one additional language while this pulsating bit of red jeweled crystal orbits your head. The DM chooses the language bestowed by the stone.

***Natural Knowledge (Rare)*** You gain proficiency in the Nature skill, or a +1 bonus to checks with that skill if already proficient, while this burnished, brassy stone orbits your head.

***Religious Knowledge (Rare)*** You gain proficiency in the Religion skill, or a +1 bonus to checks with that skill if already proficient, while this tiny golden gem orbits your head.

***Self-Preservation (Rare)*** You gain a +1 bonus to Intelligence saving throws while this silvery gem orbits your head.

***Supreme Intellect (Rare)*** You gain a +1 bonus to Intelligence checks while this faceted sphere orbits your head.

## Iron Bands of Bilarro
Wondrous Item
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, rare*

This rusty iron sphere measures 3 inches in diameter and weighs 1 pound. You can use an action to speak the command word and throw the sphere at a Huge or smaller creature you can see within 60 feet of you. As the sphere moves through the air, it opens into a tangle of metal bands.

Make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal to your Dexterity modifier plus your proficiency bonus. On a hit, the target is restrained until you take a bonus action to speak the command word again to release it. Doing so, or missing with the attack, causes the bands to contract and become a sphere once more.

A creature, including the one restrained, can use an action to make a DC 20 Strength check to break the iron bands. On a success, the item is destroyed, and the restrained creature is freed. If the check fails, any further attempts made by that creature automatically fail until 24 hours have elapsed.

Once the bands are used, they can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Lash of Immolation
Weapon
Source: Bigby Presents - Glory of the Giants

*Weapon (Whip), Rare*

The handle of this dark leather whip bears the fire rune, and embers dance around the whip’s tail.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon, and on a hit, the whip deals an extra 1d6 fire damage. When you score a critical hit with an attack using this whip, the target also has the restrained condition until the start of your next turn, as fiery bands lash around the target.

**Invoking the Rune.** When you make an attack with the whip and hit, you can use your reaction to invoke the whip’s rune. Doing so increases the extra fire damage dealt by the whip to 2d6.

Once the rune has been invoked, it can’t be invoked again until the next dawn.

## Leather Golem Armor
Armor (Attuned)
Source: Lost Laboratory of Kwalish

*Armor (leather), rare (requires attunement)*

Strange rituals have repurposed the body of a flesh golem into this partially sentient suit of leather armor. While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC and to saving throws against spells and other magical effects. In addition, you gain the following properties:

* ***Immutable Form.*** You are immune to any spell or effect that would alter your form.
* ***Lightning Absorption.*** You gain resistance to lightning damage. Whenever you take lightning damage, you gain 5 temporary hit points.

***Curse.*** This armor is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. Until the curse is broken with a [Remove Curse](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:remove-curse) spell or similar magic, you are unwilling to part with the armor. In addition, while you wear the cursed armor, you gain the following properties:

* ***Aversion of Fire.*** If you take fire damage, you have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of your next turn.
* ***Berserk.*** Whenever a critical hit is made against you, roll a d6. On a 6, the armor causes you to go berserk. On each of your turns while berserk, you attack the nearest creature you can see. If no creature is near enough to move to and attack, you attack an object, with preference for an object smaller than yourself. Once the armor causes you to go berserk, it cannot be removed. You continue to attack until you are incapacitated or until another creature is able to calm you with appropriate magic (such as a calm emotions spell) or a successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check.

## Libram of Souls and Flesh
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything

*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a wizard)*

With covers made of skin and fittings of bone, this tome is cold to the touch, and it whispers faintly. When found, the book contains the following spells, which are wizard spells for you while you are attuned to the book: [Animate Dead](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:animate-dead), [Circle of Death](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:circle-of-death), [False Life](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:false-life), [Finger of Death](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:finger-of-death), [Speak with Dead](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:speak-with-dead), [Summon Undead](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:summon-undead), [Vampiric Touch](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:vampiric-touch). It functions as a spellbook for you.

While you are holding the book, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

The book has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:

* If you spend 1 minute studying the book, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book. The new spell must be of the necromancy school.
* As an action, you can expend 1 charge to take on a semblance of undeath for 10 minutes. For the duration, you take on a deathly appearance, and undead creatures are indifferent to you, unless you have damaged them. You also appear undead to all outward inspection and to spells used to determine the target's status. The effect ends if you deal damage or force a creature to make a saving throw.

## Loadstone
Wondrous Item

This stone is a large gem worth 150 gp.

***Curse.*** The stone is cursed, but its magical nature is hidden; [Detect Magic](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:detect-magic) doesn't detect it. An [Identify](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:identify) spell reveals the stone's true nature. If you use the Dash or Disengage action while the stone is on your person, its curse activates. Until the curse is broken with [Remove Curse](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:remove-curse) or similar magic, your speed is reduced by 5 feet, and your maximum load and maximum lift capacities are halved. You also become unwilling to part with the stone.

While holding this lyre, you can cast [Mending](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:mending) as an action. You can also play the lyre as a reaction when an object or a structure you can see within 300 feet of you takes damage, causing it to be immune to that damage and any further damage of the same type until the start of your next turn.

In addition, you can play the lyre as an action to cast [Fabricate](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:fabricate), [Move Earth](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:move-earth), [Passwall](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:passwall), or [Summon Construct](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:summon-construct), and that spell can't be cast from it again until the next dawn.

## Mace of Terror
Weapon (Attuned)

*Weapon (mace), rare (requires attunement)*

This magic weapon has 3 charges. While holding it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to release a wave of terror. Each creature of your choice in a 30-foot radius extending from you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. While it is frightened in this way, a creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can use the Dodge action. At the end of its turns, a creature can use the Dodge action. At the end of each of its turns, a creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

The mace regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.

As a bonus action, you can toss the device into the air, whereupon it floats at a distance of 1d3 feet from you and you can access its properties. While the *mimir* is floating, a creature other than you can use an action to grasp or net the device, either by making a successful unarmed strike against AC 22 or a successful DC 22 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. You can use a bonus action to seize and stow the device.  
The device has AC 22, 25 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and resistance to all other damage. It is considered to be an object that is worn while it is floating near you.

## Mind Blade
Weapon (Attuned)

*Weapon (any sword), rare (requires attunement by a specific individual)*

Mind flayers can turn any nonmagical sword into a *mind blade*. Only one creature can attune to it: either a specific mind flayer or one of its thralls.

In the hands of its intended wielder, the mind blade is a magic weapon that deals an extra 2d6 psychic damage to any target it hits.

## Mind Crystal
Wondrous Item
Source: Phandelver and Below - The Shattered Obelisk

*Wondrous Item, Rarity Varies*

These gemstones contain a crystallized bit of spellcasting magic. Different types of mind crystals exist, each with a different single-use effect.

When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action while holding a mind crystal, you can modify the spell in a specific way that has an effect described below. You can use only a single mind crystal to modify the spell, and you can’t use a mind crystal and a Metamagic option on the same spell. Once you use a mind crystal, it becomes a nonmagical gem worth 50 gp.

**Careful (Uncommon).** Choose up to three creatures affected by the spell. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell.

**Distant (Uncommon).** If the spell has a range of 5 feet or more and doesn’t have a range of self, the spell’s range increases by 100 feet. If the spell has a range of touch, its range becomes 30 feet.

**Empowered (Uncommon).** When you roll damage for the spell, you can reroll up to three damage dice. You must use the new rolls.

**Extended (Uncommon).** If the spell has a duration of 1 minute or longer, double the spell’s duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.

**Heightened (Rare).** Choose one creature affected by the spell. That creature has disadvantage on the first saving throw it makes against the spell.

**Quickened (Rare).** You change the spell’s casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.

**Subtle (Common).** You cast the spell without any somatic or verbal components for this casting.

## Mind Lash
Weapon (Attuned)

In the hands of a creature other than a mind flayer, a *mind lash* functions as a normal whip. In the hands of an illithid, this magic weapon strips away a creature's will to survive as it also strips away flesh, dealing an extra 2d4 psychic damage to any target it hits. Any creature that takes psychic damage from the *mind lash* must also succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Mirror of the Past
Wondrous Item
Source: Tales from the Yawning Portal

*Wondrous item, rare*

The holder of this platinum hand mirror can learn something about the history of a specific object or creature by taking an action to gaze into the mirror and think of the target. Instead of the holder's reflection, the mirror presents scenes from the target's past. Information conveyed is accurate, but it is random and cryptic, and presented in no particular order. Once it is activated, the mirror gives its information for 1 minute or less, then returns to normal. It can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Mizzium Armor
Armor
Source: Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica

*Armor (medium or heavy, but not hide), rare*

This suit of armor is reinforced with a magically enhanced metal alloy called mizzium, which is made in Izzet foundries. While you're wearing the armor, any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit.

## Mizzium Mortar
Wondrous Item

This short tube, about 2 feet long and 6 inches in diameter, is made from mizzium, a magically enhanced metal alloy forged by the lzzet League.

The mortar has 4 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn.

***Molten Spray.*** You can expend 1 charge as an action to loose a 30-foot cone of molten mizzium. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Mizzium Bombared.*** You can expend 3 charges as an action to launch a hail of molten projectiles in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point you can see within 60 feet of you.

While wearing the armor, you have resistance to fire damage. The armor also doesn't impose disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

The bonus is determined by the weapon's rarity. In addition, you can use the sickle as a spellcasting focus for your druid and ranger spells.

When you cast a spell that restores hit points, you can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the amount of hit points restored, provided you are holding the sickle.

You can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole necklace as one action. When you do so, increase the level of the [Fireball](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:fireball) by 1 for each bead beyond the first.

## Necklace of Prayer Beads
Wondrous Item (Attuned)

*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or paladin)*

This necklace has 1d4 + 2 magic beads made from aquamarine, black pearl, or topaz. It also has many nonmagical beads made from stones such as amber, bloodstone, citrine, coral, jade, pearl, or quartz. If a magic bead is removed from the necklace, that bead loses its magic.

Six types of magic beads exist. The DM decides the type of each bead on the necklace or determines it randomly. A necklace can have more than one bead of the same type. To use one, you must be wearing the necklace. Each bead contains a spell that you can cast from it as a bonus action (using your spell save DC if a save is necessary). Once a magic bead's spell is cast, that bead can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Opal of the Ild Rune
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Storm King's Thunder

*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

This triangular fire opal measures about three inches on each side and is half an inch thick. The ild (fire) rune shimmers within its core, causing it to be slightly warm to the touch. The opal has the following properties, which work only while it's on your person.

***Ignite.*** As an action, you can ignite an object within 10 feet of you. The object must be flammable, and the fire starts in a circle no larger than 1 foot in diameter.

***Fire's Friend.*** You have resistance to cold damage.

***Fire Tamer.*** As an action, you can extinguish any open flame within 10 feet of you. You choose how much fire to extinguish in that radius.

***Gift of Flame.*** You can transfer the opal's magic to a nonmagical item — a weapon or a suit of armor — by tracing the ild rune there with your finger. The transfer takes 8 hours of work that requires the two items to be within 5 feet of each other. At the end, the opal is destroyed, and the rune appears in red on the chosen item, which gains a benefit based on its form:

* Weapon. The weapon is now an uncommon magic weapon. It deals an extra 1d6 fire damage to any target it hits.
* Armor. The armor is now a rare magic item that requires attunement. You have resistance to cold damage while wearing the armor.

## Orb of the Stein Rune

***Indomitable Stand.*** As an action, you can channel the orb's magic to hold your ground. For the next minute or until you move any distance, you have advantage on all checks and saving throws to resist effects that force you to move. In addition, any enemy that moves to a space within 10 feet of you must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or be unable to move any farther this turn.

***Stone Soul.*** You can't be petrified.

***Earthen Step.*** You can cast [Meld into Stone](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:meld-into-stone) as a bonus action. Once you use this property, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

***Gift of Stone.*** You can transfer the orb's magic to a nonmagical item — a shield or a pair of boots — by tracing the stein rune there with your finger. The transfer takes 8 hours of work that requires the two items to be within 5 feet of each other. At the end, the orb is destroyed, and the rune appears in silver on the chosen item, which gains a benefit based on its form:

* **Shield.** The shield is now a rare magic item that requires attunement. While you wield it, you have resistance to all damage dealt by ranged weapon attacks.
* **Boots.** The pair of boots is now an uncommon magic item that requires attunement. While you wear the boots, you have advantage on Strength saving throws, and you can use your reaction to avoid being knocked prone.

## Outer Essence Shard
Wondrous Item (Attuned)

This flickering crystal holds the essence of an Outer Plane. As an action, you can attach the shard to a Tiny object (such as a weapon or a piece of jewelry) or detach it. It falls off if your attunement to it ends. You can use the shard as a spellcasting focus while you hold or wear it.

Roll a d4 and consult the Outer Essence Shards table to determine the shard's essence and property. When you use a Metamagic option on a spell while you are holding or wearing the shard, you can use that property.

*Armor (shield), rare (requires attunement)*

Soldiers of the Boros Legion consider it an honor to bear this shield, even knowing that it might be the last honor they receive. The front of the shield is sculpted to depict a grieving human face.

You gain a +1 bonus to AC for every two allies within 5 feet of you (up to a maximum of +3) while you wield this shield. This bonus is in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC.

This cloak is a [Cloak of Elvenkind](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:cloak-of-elvenkind). It also grants you resistance to fire damage while you wear it. It loses its magic if exposed to sunlight for 1 hour without interruption.

## Planecaller's Codex
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything

*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a wizard)*

The pages of this book are bound in fiend hide, and its cover is embossed with a diagram of the Great Wheel of the multiverse. When found, the book contains the following spells: [Banishment](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:banishment), [Find Familiar](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:find-familiar), [Gate](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:gate), [Magic Circle](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:magic-circle), [Planar Binding](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:planar-binding), and [Summon Elemental](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:summon-elemental). It functions as a spellbook for you.

While you are holding the book, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

The book has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:

* If you spend 1 minute studying the book, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book. The new spell must be of the conjuration school.
* When you cast a conjuration spell that summons or creates one creature, you can expend 1 charge to grant that creature advantage on attack rolls for 1 minute.

## Portable Hole
Wondrous Item
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, rare*

This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.

You can use an action to unfold a *portable hole* and place it on or against a solid surface, whereupon the *portable hole* creates an extradimensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different plane, so it can't be used to create open passages. Any creature inside an open *portable hole* can exit the hole by climbing out of it.

You can use an action to close a *portable hole* by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space. No matter what's in it, the hole weighs next to nothing.

If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole's extradimensional space can use an action to make a DC 10 Strength check. On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the *portable hole* or the creature carrying it. A breathing creature within a closed portable hole can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.

Placing a *portable hole* inside an extradimensional space created by a [Bag of Holding](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:bag-of-holding), [Heward's Handy Haversack](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:hewards-handy-haversack), or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.

If the target's initial saving throw fails, the effect lasts for 1 hour, with no concentration required on your part. The charmed creature has disadvantage on new saving throws to break the effect during this time.

## Prehistoric Figurines of Wondrous Power
Wondrous Item
Source: Bigby Presents - Glory of the Giants

*Wondrous Item, Varies*

Larger and more roughly hewn than typical figurines of wondrous power, these statuettes depict dinosaurs and related creatures from the earliest days of the world.

As an action, you can throw a prehistoric figurine of wondrous power to a point on the ground within 60 feet of yourself while speaking a command word, whereupon the figurine magically transforms into a living creature. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn’t enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn’t become a creature.

The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions. See the *Monster Manual* for the creature’s statistics.

The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its statuette form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can’t be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine’s description.

**Carnelian Triceratops (Very Rare).** This figurine becomes a triceratops for up to 6 hours and can be ridden as a mount. Once it has been used, it can’t be used again until 10 days have passed.

**Jasper Tyrannosaurus Rex (Legendary).** This figurine, crafted from rare green jasper, becomes a tyrannosaurus rex for up to 1 hour. Once it has been used, it can’t be used again until 14 days have passed.

Whenever you command the figurine while it’s in tyrannosaurus rex form (including commanding it to revert to figurine form), you must roll a d20. On a 1, you lose control of the figurine, and it becomes hostile to you and your companions until it is reduced to 0 hit points, at which point it reverts to figurine form.

**Kyanite Pteranodon (Rare).** This figurine becomes a pteranodon for up to 8 hours. If your size is Medium or smaller, you can ride the pteranodon as a mount. Once it has been used, it can’t be used again until 7 days have passed.

**Pyrite Plesiosaurus (Uncommon).** This figurine becomes a plesiosaurus for up to 12 hours and can be ridden as a mount. Once it has been used, it can’t be used again until 4 days have passed.

While you are riding the plesiosaurus, you can use it to cast [Water Breathing](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:water-breathing) at will.

## Professor Orb
Wondrous Item
Source: Icewind Dale - Rime of the Frostmaiden

*Wondrous item, rare*

A *professor orb* is a smooth 5-pound sphere of smoky gray quartz about the size of a grapefruit. Close examination reveals two or more pinpricks of silver light coming from deep inside the sphere.

The orb is sentient and has the personality of a scholar. Its alignment is determined by rolling on the alignment table in the "Sentient Magic Items" section in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*. Regardless of its alignment, the orb has an Intelligence of 18, and Wisdom and Charisma scores determined by rolling 3d6 for each ability. The orb speaks, reads, and understands four languages, and it can see and hear normally out to a range of 60 feet. Unlike most other sentient items, the orb has no goals of its own and can't initiate a conflict with the creature in possession of it.

The orb has extensive knowledge of four narrow academic subjects. When making an Intelligence check to recall lore from any of its areas of expertise, the orb has a +9 bonus to its roll (including its Intelligence modifier).

In addition to the knowledge it possesses, the orb can cast the [Mage Hand](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:mage-hand) cantrip at will. It uses the spell only to transport itself. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence.

***Professor Skant.*** The *professor orb* owned by Vellynne Harpell and stolen by Nass Lantomir calls itself Professor Skant. It is lawful good, and it has a Wisdom of 11 and a Charisma of 9. It speaks and reads Common, Draconic, Elvish, and Loross (the dead language of the Empire of Netheril). Professor Skant is a chatterbox and assumes all humanoids are dunderheads. When elaborating on its areas of expertise, it adopts an unintentionally patronizing tone. It has the following four areas of expertise:

* The history of Netheril
* Vampirism and the traits of vampires
* Rituals surrounding the making, bottling, and drinking of Elverquisst (a rare, ruby-colored elven liquor distilled from sunshine and rare summer fruits)
* The tarrasque (see the *Monster Manual*)

Wondrous Item (Attuned)

When found, the book contains the following spells: [Arcane Lock](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:arcane-lock), [Dispel Magic](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:dispel-magic), [Globe of Invulnerability](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:globe-of-invulnerability), [Glyph of Warding](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:glyph-of-warding), [Mordenkainen's Private Sanctum](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:mordenkainens-private-sanctum), [Protection from Evil and Good](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:protection-from-evil-and-good), and [Symbol](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:symbol). It functions as a spellbook for you.

While you are holding the book, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

The book has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:

* If you spend 1 minute studying the book, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book. The new spell must be of the abjuration school.
* When you cast an abjuration spell, you can expend 1 charge to grant a creature you can see within 30 feet of you 2d10 temporary hit points.

## Quaal's Feather Token
Wondrous Item
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, rare*

This tiny object looks like a feather. Different types of feather tokens exist, each with a different single-use effect. The DM chooses the kind of token or determines it randomly.

|d100 |Feather Token|
|-----|-------------|
|01-20|   Anchor    |
|21-35|    Bird     |
|36-50|     Fan     |
|51-65|  Swan boat  |
|66-90|    Tree     |
|91-00|    Whip     |

***Anchor.*** You can use an action to touch the token to a boat or ship. For the next 24 hours, the vessel can't be moved by any means. Touching the token to the vessel again ends the effect. When the effect ends, the token disappears.

***Bird.*** You can use an action to toss the token 5 feet into the air. The token disappears and an enormous, multicolored bird takes its place. The bird has the statistics of a roc (see the *Monster Manual*), but it obeys your simple commands and can't attack. It can carry up to 500 pounds while flying at its maximum speed (16 miles an hour for a maximum of 144 miles per day, with a one-hour rest for every 3 hours of flying), or 1,000 pounds at half that speed. The bird disappears after flying its maximum distance for a day or if it drops to 0 hit points. You can dismiss the bird as an action.

***Fan.*** If you are on a boat or ship, you can use an action to toss the token up to 10 feet in the air. The token disappears, and a giant flapping fan takes its place. The fan floats and creates a wind strong enough to fill the sails of one ship, increasing its speed by 5 miles per hour for 8 hours. You can dismiss the fan as an action.

***Swan Boat.*** You can use an action to touch the token to a body of water at least 60 feet in diameter. The token disappears, and a 50-foot-long, 20-foot-wide boat shaped like a swan takes its place. The boat is self-propelled and moves across water at a speed of 6 miles per hour. You can use an action while on the boat to command it to move or to turn up to 90 degrees. The boat can carry up to thirty-two Medium or smaller creatures. A Large creature counts as four Medium creatures, while a Huge creature counts as nine. The boat remains for 24 hours and then disappears. You can dismiss the boat as an action.

***Tree.*** You must be outdoors to use this token. You can use an action to touch it to an unoccupied space on the ground. The token disappears, and in its place a nonmagical oak tree springs into existence. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius.

***Whip.*** You can use an action to throw the token to a point within 10 feet of you. The token disappears, and a floating whip takes its place. You can then use a bonus action to make a melee spell attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip, with an attack bonus of +9. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 + 5 force damage.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can direct the whip to fly up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 10 feet of it. The whip disappears after 1 hour, when you use an action to dismiss it, or when you are incapacitated or die.

## Ring of Spell Storing
Ring (Attuned)
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Ring, rare (requires attunement)*

This ring stores spells cast into it, holding them until the attuned wearer uses them. The ring can store up to 5 levels worth of spells at a time. When found, it contain 1d6 - 1 levels of stored spells chosen by the DM.

Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 5th level into the ring by touching the ring as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the ring. If the ring can't hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.

While wearing this ring, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the ring is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.

At the end of each of your turns, you can make a Constitution saving throw (DC 11 for [Light](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:light) or DC 15 for [Dayight](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:daylight)), ending the blindness on a success.

Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for 8 hours. While charmed in this way, the creature regards you as its trusted leader.

The fire giant duke Zalto hired a wizard to craft several of these adamantine rods. Each measures 4 feet long, weighs 100 pounds, and is sized to fit comfortably in a fire giant's hand. The rod has two prongs at one end and a molded handle grip on the opposite end.

The rod has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 of its expended charges daily at dawn. As an action, you can grasp it by the handle and expend 1 charge to cast the [Locate Object](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:locate-object) spell from it. When the rod is used to detect objects made of adamantine, such as fragments of the Vonindod construct, its range increases to 10 miles.

*Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement)*

This dark, hooded mantle of thick cloth is infused with secretive and deceptive magic. While wearing it, you gain the following benefits:

**Darkvision.** You gain darkvision within a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, the mantle increases your darkvision’s range by 60 feet instead.

**Move in Shadows.** While you are in dim light or darkness, you can use a bonus action to teleport, along with anything you are wearing or carrying, up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light or darkness. You then have advantage on the first melee attack you make before the end of the turn.

**Willful Enmity.** You can cast the [Antagonize](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:antagonize) spell (save DC 15) from the mantle. Once the mantle has cast the spell, it can’t cast the spell again until the next dawn.

## Rope of Entanglement
Wondrous Item
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, rare*

This rope is 30 feet long and weighs 3 pounds. If you hold one end of the rope and use an action to speak its command word, the other end darts forward to entangle a creature you can see within 20 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or become restrained.

You can release the creature by using a bonus action to speak a second command word. A target restrained by the rope can use an action to make a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity check (target's choice). On a success, the creature is no longer restrained by the rope.

The rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.

## Ruinous Flail
Weapon (Attuned)

*Weapon (flail), rare (requires attunement)*

This ash-gray flail is cold to the touch. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, and it deals double damage to objects and structures.

Additionally, when you hit a creature with this weapon, you can force the creature to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has the poisoned condition for 1 minute. The poisoned creature takes 2d4 necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once this property is used in this way, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

## Sage's Signet
Ring (Attuned)

Once you use the ring to cast the spell, the ring can’t cast the spell again until the next dawn.

Six varieties of Sage’s Signet rings exist, each with a different signet (see the table below). A ring’s signet determines its rarity as well as the additional spells it can cast.

## Saint Markovia's Thighbone
Weapon (Attuned)
Source: Curse of Strahd

*Weapon (mace), rare (requires attunement)*

*Saint Markovia's thighbone* has the properties of a [Mace of Disruption](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:mace-of-disruption). If it scores one or more hits against a vampire or a vampire spawn in the course of a single battle, the thighbone crumbles into dust once the battle concludes.

As a youth, Markovia followed her heart and became a priest of the Morninglord soon after her eighteenth birthday. She proved to be a charismatic proselytizer and, before the age of thirty, had gained a reputation for allowing no evil to stand before her.

Markovia had long considered Strahd a mad tyrant, but only after his transformation into a vampire did she dare to challenge him. As she rallied her followers and prepared to march on Castle Ravenloft, Strahd sent a group of vampire spawn to her abbey. They confronted Markovia and were destroyed to a one.

Suffused with confidence born of righteous victory, Markovia advanced on Castle Ravenloft. A great battle raged from the catacombs to the parapets. In the end, Markovia never returned to Barovia, and Strahd long afterward walked with a limp and a grimace of pain. It is said that he trapped Markovia in a crypt beneath his castle, and her remains linger there yet.

The essence of Markovia's saintliness passed partly into her bones as the rest of her body decomposed. Her remaining thighbone is imbued with power that inflicts grievous injury on the undead.

## Scaled Ornament
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Fizban's Treasury of Dragons

*Wondrous Item, Rarity Varies (Requires Attunement)*

This ornament can be jewelry, a cloak, or another wearable accessory. It appears to be fashioned from a dragon’s scale, tooth, or claw, or it incorporates images in those shapes.

**Slumbering (Uncommon).** You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid being charmed or frightened or to end those conditions on you.

**Stirring (Rare).** You gain a +1 bonus to AC, and you can’t be charmed or frightened. Moreover, each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you has advantage on saving throws it makes to avoid being charmed or frightened or to end those conditions on itself.

**Wakened (Very Rare).** The Wakened ornament has the Stirring property. In addition, when you would take damage of the type dealt by the breath of the dragon in whose hoard the ornament became Wakened, you can use your reaction to take no damage instead, and you regain hit points equal to the damage you would have taken. Once this property is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

**Ascendant (Legendary).** The Ascendant ornament has the Stirring and Wakened properties. In addition, while you are wearing the ornament, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover. While you are flying using this speed, spectral dragon wings appear on your back.

## Scissors of Shadow Snipping
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: The Wild Beyond The Witchlight

*Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement by a Fey or a Spellcaster)*

As an action, you make a few snips with these iron shears and cause the shadow of a Humanoid creature you can see within 5 feet of you to detach from its source. If the creature is unwilling to give up its shadow, it can make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw, retaining its shadow on a success. Whether or not the shadow is snipped, this property of the scissors can't be used again until the next dawn.

The detached shadow is rooted to the spot where it was snipped until you use a bonus action to cause it to behave in one of the following ways, either of which is possible only if you can see the shadow:

* You control the shadow's movements and can make the shadow move up to 30 feet across a solid or liquid surface, in any direction you choose (including along vertical surfaces), provided it remains within your sight at all times. The shadow is harmless and unable to be harmed, and it is invisible in darkness. It can't speak, and it doesn't require air, sleep, or nourishment.
* You can relinquish control of the shadow, at which point it becomes autonomous and behaves as the DM wishes. It uses the **shadow** stat block in the *Monster Manual*, but its creature type is Fey instead of Undead. A creature whose Strength is reduced to 0 by this shadow's Strength Drain attack does not die but falls unconscious instead. The creature regains consciousness and all its Strength after finishing a short or long rest.

A creature whose shadow has detached from it is cursed. If a shadowless creature is subjected to any spell that ends a curse, or if its detached shadow is reduced to 0 hit points, the detached shadow disappears, and the creature regains its normal shadow instantly.

## Scorpion Armor
Armor (Attuned)
Source: Tomb of Annihilation

*Armor (plate), rare (requires attunement)*

This suit of plate armor is fashioned from giant scorpion chitin. While wearing this armor, you gain the following benefits:

* The armor improves your combat readiness, granting you a +5 bonus to initiative as long as you aren't incapacitated.
* The armor doesn't impose disadvantage on your Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
* The armor doesn't impose disadvantage on saving throws made to resist the effects of extreme heat (see chapter 5 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*).

***Curse.*** This armor is cursed. Whenever you don or doff it, you must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 100 (10d10 + 45) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Only a [Wish](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:wish) spell can remove the armor's curse.

## Scroll of Protection
Scroll
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Scroll, rare*

Each *scroll of protection* works against a specific type of creature chosen by the DM or determined randomly by rolling on the following table.

|d100 |Creature Type|
|-----|-------------|
|01-10| Aberrations |
|11-20|   Beasts    |
|21-30| Celestials  |
|31-40| Elementals  |
|41-50|     Fey     |
|51-60|   Fiends    |
|61-70|   Plants    |
|81-00|   Undead    |

Using an action to read the scroll encloses you in a invisible barrier that extends from you to form a 5-foot-radius, 10-foot-high cylinder. For 5 minutes, this barrier prevents creatures of the specified type from entering or affecting anything within the cylinder.

The cylinder moves with you and remains centered on you. However, if you move in such a way that a creature of the specified type would be inside the cylinder, the effect ends.

A creature can attempt to overcome the barrier by using an action to make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a success, the creature ceases to be affected by the barrier.

## Serpent's Fang
Weapon
Source: Candlekeep Mysteries

*Weapon (longsword), rare*

This single-edged magic sword is made from the scrimshawed fang of a giant serpent. Its hilt changes shape to adjust to the grasp of any creature that picks it up. The weapon deals an extra 1d10 poison damage to any target it hits.

## Shadowfell Brand Tattoo
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything

*Wondrous item (tattoo), rare (requires attunement)*

Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo is dark in color and abstract.

**Tattoo Attunement.** To attune to this item, you hold the needle to your skin where you want the tattoo to appear, pressing the needle there throughout the attunement process. When the attunement is complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the skin.

If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo vanishes, and the needle reappears in your space.

**Shadow Essence.** You gain darkvision with a range of 60 feet, and you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

**Shadowy Defense.** When you take damage, you can use your reaction to become insubstantial for a moment, halving the damage you take. Then the reaction can't be used again until the next sunset.

## Shadowfell Shard
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything

*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a sorcerer)*

This dull, cold crystal sits heavy and leaden, saturated by the Shadowfell's despair. As an action, you can attach the shard to a Tiny object (such as a weapon or a piece of jewelry) or detach it. It falls off if your attunement to it ends. You can use the shard as a spellcasting focus while you hold or wear it.

When you use a Metamagic option on a spell while you are holding or wearing the shard, you can momentarily curse one creature targeted by the spell; choose one ability score, and until the end of your next turn, the creature has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws that use that ability.

## Shard of Xeluan
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Keys from the Golden Vault

*Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)*

This 1-foot-long shard of obsidian has veins of silver and gold beneath its cold surface.

***Empowered Magic.*** While holding the shard, you can use it as a spellcasting focus, and it gives you a +1 bonus to your spell attack rolls.

***Enhanced Strength.*** Your Strength score increases by 4 while the shard is on your person. The shard can't raise your Strength score above 22.

***Curse.*** Attuning to this item extends its curse to you. You remain cursed until you are targeted by a [Remove Curse](/spell:remove-curse) spell or similar magic, or until the shard is reattached to Xeluan's petrified heart.

The shard's curse causes misfortune to befall you. When you roll a 1 on an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, roll on the Shard Misfortunes table to determine the misfortune. For as long as this misfortune lasts, no other shard misfortunes befall you.

|Shard Misfortunes|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

As long as the shield is on the same plane of existence as its creator, the mind flayer can see through the shield's eye, which has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. While peering through this magical eye, the mind flayer can use its Mind Blast action as though it were standing behind the shield.

While holding the gem. you can cast the spell from it as an action if you know the spell or if the spell is on your class spell list. Doing so doesn‘t require any components and doesn't require attunement. The spell then disappears from the gem.

If the spell is of a higher level than you can normally cast. you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a failed check. the spell disappears from the gem with no other effect.

Each *spell gem* has a maximum level for the spell it can store. The spell level determines the gems rarity and the stored spell's saving throw DC and attack bonus. as shown in the Spell Gem table.

You can imbue the gem with a spell if you're attuned to it and it's empty. To do so, you cast the spell while holding the gem. The spell is stored in the gem instead of having any effect. Casting the spell must require either 1 action or 1 minute or longer, and the spell's level must be no higher than the gem's maximum. If the spell belongs to the school of abjuration and requires material components that are consumed. you must provide them. but they can be worth half as much as normal.

Once imbued with a spell. the gem can't be imbued again until the next dawn.

Deep gnomes created these magic gemstones and keep the creation process a secret.

If the spell is on your class’s spell list, you can read the scroll and cast its spell without providing any material components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible. Casting the spell by reading the scroll requires the spell’s normal casting time. Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and it crumbles to dust. If the casting is interrupted, the scroll is not lost.

If the spell is on your class's spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect.

Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and the scroll itself crumbles to dust.

The level of the spell on the scroll determines the spell's saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as the scroll's rarity, as shown in the Spell Scroll table.

|Spell Scroll|         |       |            |

A wizard spell on a *spell scroll* can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When a spell is copied from a *spell scroll*, the copier must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the *spell scroll* is destroyed.

## Spelljamming Helm
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Spelljammer: Adventures in Space - Astral Adventurer's Guide

*Wondrous item, Rare (Requires Attunement by a Spellcaster)*

The function of this ornate chair is to propel and maneuver a ship on which it has been installed through space and air. It can also propel and maneuver a ship on water or underwater, provided the ship is built for such travel. The ship in question must weigh 1 ton or more.

The sensation of being attuned to a *spelljamming helm* is akin to the pins-and-needles effect one experiences after one's arm or leg falls asleep, but not painful.

While attuned to a *spelljamming helm* and sitting in it, you gain the following abilities for as long as you maintain concentration (as if concentrating on a spell):

* You can use the *spelljamming helm* to move the ship through space, air, or water up to the ship's speed. If the ship is in space and no other objects weighing 1 ton or more are within 1 mile of it, you can use the *spelljamming helm* to move the vessel fast enough to travel 100 million miles in 24 hours.

* You can steer the vessel, albeit in a somewhat clumsy fashion, in much the way a rudder or oars can be used to maneuver a seafaring ship.

* At any time, you can see and hear what's happening on and around the vessel as though you were standing in a location of your choice aboard it.

***Transfer Attunement.*** You can use an action to touch a willing spellcaster. That creature attunes to the *spelljamming helm* immediately, and your attunement to it ends.

## Spellwrought Tattoo
Wondrous Item
Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything

*Wondrous item (tattoo), rarity varies*

Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo contains a single spell of up to 5th level, wrought on your skin by a magic needle. To use the tattoo, you must hold the needle against your skin and speak the command word. The needle turns into ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the skin in whatever design you like. Once the tattoo is there, you can cast its spell, requiring no material components. The tattoo glows faintly while you cast the spell and for the spell's duration. Once the spell ends, the tattoo vanishes from your skin.

The level of the spell in the tattoo determines the spell's saving throw DC, attack bonus, spellcasting ability modifier, and the tattoo's rarity, as shown in the Spellwrought Tattoo table.

**Orb of Lightning.** You create a Small orb of lightning in an unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet of yourself. You concentrate on this orb as if concentrating on a spell. As a bonus action, you can move the orb up to 20 feet in any direction.  
When your concentration ends, or when a creature enters the orb's space or starts its turn there, the orb detonates in a 20-foot-radius sphere. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking lightning damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one; the orb's base damage is 6d6, and if at the end of your turn the orb hasn't detonated, its damage increases by 2d6, to a maximum of 10d6.

**Staff to Snake.** You throw the staff to an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you, and the staff becomes a giant poisonous snake. The snake is under your control and shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours.  
On your turn, you can mentally command the snake if it is within 60 feet of you and you don't have the incapacitated condition. You decide what action the snake takes and where it moves during its turn, or you can issue it a general command, such as to attack your enemies or guard a location.

If you use a bonus action to speak the command word again, or if the snake is reduced to 0 hit points, the snake reverts to staff form in its current space.

**Thunderclap.** You point the staff skyward, producing a fearsome thunderclap. Each creature of your choice in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the deafened and frightened conditions until the end of your next turn.

The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius. The tree appears ordinary but radiates a faint aura of transmutation magic if targeted by detect magic.

## Ventilating Lungs
Wondrous Item (Attuned)

The projection is a translucent copy of you that has immunity to all damage and conditions, and you can make attacks and cast spells with a range other than self as if standing in the projection’s space. The projection disappears at the end of your turn. Once you use this bonus action, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

**Curse.** This armor is cursed, and attuning to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you’re unwilling to part with the armor. Taking it off fails to end the curse. While cursed in this way, you feel disconnected from your body, continuously hearing whispers that call for you to join them. Whenever you finish a long rest while cursed, you must make a DC 11 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, your soul is drawn from your body and trapped in an object on a different plane of existence. The object and location of this object are chosen by the DM (but might be the House of Cards; see chapter 18). While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is inert and doesn’t age or require sustenance. Destroying the object frees your soul; otherwise, only a [Wish](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:wish) spell can restore your soul to your body.

This wand has 7 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.

**Command.** While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and command another creature to flee or grovel, as with the [Command](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:command) spell (save DC 15).

**Cone of Fear.** While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 2 charges, causing the wand's tip to emit a 60-foot cone of amber light. Each creature in the cone must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. While it is frightened in this way, a creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can use the Dodge action. At the end of each of its turns, a creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. At the end of each of the target's turns, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Wand of Viscid Globs
Wand (Attuned)
Source: Out of the Abyss

*Wand, rare (requires attunement)*

Crafted by the drow, this slim black wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cause a small glob of viscous material to launch from the tip at one creature within 60 feet of you. Make a ranged attack roll against the target, with a bonus equal to your spellcasting modifier (or your Intelligence modifier, if you don't have a spellcasting ability) plus your proficiency bonus. On a hit, the glob expands and dries on the target, which is restrained for 1 hour. After that time, the viscous material cracks and falls away.

Applying a pint or more of alcohol to the restrained creature dissolves the glob instantly, as does the application of [Oil of Etherealness](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:oil-of-etherealness) or [Universal Solvent](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:universal-solvent). The glob also dissolves instantly if exposed to sunlight. No other nonmagical processes can remove the viscous material until it deteriorates on its own.

The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at midnight. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand melts into harmless slime and is destroyed.

A *Wand of Viscid Globs* is destroyed if exposed to sunlight for 1 hour without interruption.

*Wand, rare (requires attunement)*

This wand looks and feels like an icicle.

The wand has 7 charges, which are used to fuel the spells within it. With the wand in hand, you can use your action to cast one of the following spells from the wand, even if you are incapable of casting spells: [Ray of Frost](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:ray-of-frost) (no charges, or 1 charge to cast at 5th level; +5 to hit with ranged spell attack), [Sleet Storm](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:sleet-storm) (3 charges; spell save DC 15), or [Ice Storm](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:ice-storm) (4 charges; spell save DC 15). No other components are required.

The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges each day at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 20, the wand melts away, forever destroyed.

## Wand of Wonder

*Wand, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges and choose a target within 120 feet of you. The target can be a creature, an object, or a point in space. Roll d100 and consult the following table to discover what happens.

If the effect causes you to cast a spell from the wand, the spell's save DC is 15. If the spell normally has a range expressed in feet, its range becomes 120 feet if it isn't already.

If an effect covers an area, you must center the spell on and include the target. If an effect has multiple possible subjects, the DM randomly determines which ones are affected.

The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into dust and is destroyed.

You can blow the horn as a bonus action. When you do, if you have the frightened condition, you immediately end that condition on yourself. You also have advantage on saving throws against being frightened until the start of your next turn.

**Invoking the Rune.** When you blow the horn, you can also invoke the rune, imbuing the horn’s deep call with protective magic that affects creatures of your choice within 30 feet of yourself. You and all affected creatures gain a +1 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.

Once the rune has been invoked, it can’t be invoked again until the next dawn.

## Warrior's Passkey
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: The Book of Many Things

This silver skeleton key is warm to the touch. While holding the key in its key form, you can use an action to cast the [Knock](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:knock) spell from the key.

**Transforming the Key.** While holding the key, you can use a bonus action to transform it into a magic longsword. You are considered proficient with the sword, and you have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. On a hit, the sword deals 1d10 force damage. The item remains in its sword form until it leaves your grasp or you use another bonus action to revert it to its key form.

If you end your attunement to the item while it’s in its sword form, it automatically reverts to its key form.

## Weird Tank
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Princes of the Apocalypse

*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

A *Weird Tank* is a ten-gallon tank of blown glass and sculpted bronze with a backpack-like carrying harness fashioned from tough leather. A **water weird** (see the *Monster Manual* for statistics) is contained within the tank. While wearing the tank, you can use an action to open it, allowing the water weird to emerge. The water weird acts immediately after you in the initiative order, and it is bound to the tank.

You can command the water weird telepathically (no action required) while you wear the tank. You can close the tank as an action only if you have first commanded the water weird to retract into it or if the water weird is dead.

If the water weird is killed, the tank loses its magical containment property until it spends at least 24 hours inside an elemental water node. When the tank is recharged, a new water weird forms inside it.

The tank has AC 15, 50 hit points, vulnerability to bludgeoning damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Reducing the tank to 0 hit points destroys it and the water weird contained within it.

## Wings of Flying
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

While wearing this cloak, you can use an action to speak its command word. This turns the cloak into a pair of bat wings or bird wings on your back for 1 hour or until you repeat the command word as an action. The wings give you a flying speed of 60 feet. When they disappear, you can't use them again for 1d12 hours.

Source: The Book of Many Things
