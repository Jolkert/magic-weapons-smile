## Abracadabrus
Wondrous Item
Source: Icewind Dale - Rime of the Frostmaiden

*Wondrous item, very rare*

An *abracadabrus* is an ornate, gemstone-studded wooden chest that weighs 25 pounds while empty. Its interior compartment is a cube measuring 1 1/2 feet on a side.

The chest has 20 charges. A creature can use an action to touch the closed lid of the chest and expend 1 of the chest's charges while naming one or more nonmagical objects (including raw materials, foodstuffs, and liquids) worth a total of 1 gp or less. The named objects magically appear in the chest, provided they can all fit inside it and the chest doesn't contain anything else. For example, the chest can conjure a plate of strawberries, a bowl of hot soup, a flagon of water, a stuffed animal, or a bag of twenty caltrops. Food and drink conjured by the chest are delicious, and they spoil if not consumed after 24 hours. Gems and precious metals created by the chest disappear after 1 minute.

The chest regains 1d20 expended charges daily at dawn. If the item's last charge is expended, roll a d20. On a 1, the chest loses its magic (becoming an ordinary chest), and its gemstones turn to dust.

## Absorbing Tattoo
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything

*Wondrous item (tattoo), very rare (requires attunement)*

Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo features designs that emphasize one color.

**Tattoo Attunement.** To attune to this item, you hold the needle to your skin where you want the tattoo to appear, pressing the needle there throughout the attunement process. When the attunement is complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the skin.

If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo vanishes, and the needle reappears in your space.

**Damage Resistance.** While the tattoo is on your skin, you have resistance to a type of damage associated with that color, as shown on the table below. The DM chooses the color or determines it randomly.

|Absorbing Tattoo|           |      |
|----------------|-----------|------|
|      d10       |Damage Type|Color |
|       1        |   Acid    |Green |
|       2        |   Cold    | Blue |
|       3        |   Fire    | Red  |
|       4        |   Force   |White |

|       6        | Necrotic  |Black |
|       7        |  Poison   |Violet|

|       9        |  Radiant  | Gold |
|       10       |  Thunder  |Orange|

**Damage Absorption.** When you take damage of the chosen type, you can use your reaction to gain immunity against that instance of the damage, and you regain a number of hit points equal to half the damage you would have taken. Once this reaction is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

## All-Purpose Tool
Wondrous Item (Attuned)

*Wondrous item, uncommon (+1), rare (+2), very rare (+3) (requires attunement by an artificer)*

This simple screwdriver can transform into a variety of tools; as an action, you can touch the item and transform it into any type of artisan's tool of your choice (see the "Equipment" chapter in the *Player's Handbook* for a list of artisan's tools). Whatever form the tool takes, you are proficient with it. While holding this tool, you gain a bonus to the spell attack rolls and the saving throw DCs of your artificer spells. The bonus is determined by the tool's rarity.

As an action, you can focus on the tool to channel your creative forces. Choose a cantrip that you don't know from any class list. For 8 hours, you can cast that cantrip, and it counts as an artificer cantrip for you. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

*Wondrous item, Very Rare (requires attunement)*

This fist-sized chunk of amethyst is infused with an amethyst dragon’s ability to bend gravitational forces. While you are carrying the lodestone, you have advantage on Strength saving throws.

The lodestone has 6 charges for the following properties, which you can use while you are holding the stone. The stone regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.

**Flight.** As a bonus action, you can expend 1 charge to gain the power of flight for 10 minutes. For the duration, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed, and you can hover.

**Gravitational Thrust.** As an action, you can expend 1 charge to focus gravity around a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 20 feet in a direction of your choice.

**Reverse Gravity.** As an action, you can expend 3 charges to cast [Reverse Gravity](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:reverse-gravity) from the stone (save DC 18).

## Amulet of the Black Skull
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Tomb of Annihilation

*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*

This amulet is carved from obsidian and shaped like a screaming humanoid skull, with ruby eyes and emeralds for teeth. It hangs from an iron chain necklace.

The amulet has 6 charges and regains 1d6 charges daily at dawn. While wearing the amulet, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to transport yourself and anything you are wearing or carrying to a location within 100 feet of you. The destination you choose doesn't need to be in your line of sight, but it must be familiar to you (in other words, a place you have seen or visited), and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. This effect isn't subject to the magic restrictions placed on the Tomb of the Nine Gods; thus, the amulet can be used to enter and exit the tomb.

If you aren't undead, you must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw each time you use the amulet to teleport. On a failed saving throw, the black skull cackles as you are transformed in transit. The transformation takes effect as soon as you arrive at the destination, and is determined randomly by rolling percentile dice and consulting the Black Skull Transformation table.

|Black Skull Transformation|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

## Arcane Cannon
Wondrous Item
Source: Explorer's Guide to Wildemount

*Wondrous item, very rare*

This Large cannon is imbued with magic. It requires no ammunition and doesn't need to be loaded. It takes one action to aim the cannon and one action to fire it. After the cannon has fired, it must recharge for 5 minutes before it can be fired again.

The creature firing the cannon chooses the effect from the following options:

***Acid Jet.*** The cannon discharges acid in a line 300 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, a creature that fails its saving throw takes 11 (2d10) acid damage at the start of each of its turns; a creature can end this damage by using its action to wash off the acid with a pint or more of water.

***Fire Jet.*** The cannon discharges fire in a line 300 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 33 (6d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

***Frost Shot.*** The cannon shoots a ball of frost to a point you can see within 1,200 feet of the cannon. The ball then expands to form a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 22 (4d10) cold damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and its speed isn't reduced. A creature whose speed is reduced by this effect can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Lightning Shot.*** The cannon shoots a ball of lightning to a point you can see within 1,200 feet of the cannon. The lightning then expands to form a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 33 (6dl0) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures wearing metal armor have disadvantage on the save.

***Poison Spray.*** The cannon expels poison gas in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 22 (4d10) poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't poisoned. A creature poisoned in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Arcane Grimoire

*Wondrous item, uncommon (+1), rare (+2), very rare (+3) (requires attunement by a wizard)*

## Arcane Propulsion Arm
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Eberron - Rising from the Last War

*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a creature missing a hand or an arm)*

This prosthetic appendage was developed by artificers of House Cannith. To attune to this item, you must attach it to your arm at the wrist, elbow, or shoulder, at which point the prosthetic magically forms a copy of the appendage it's replacing.

While attached, the prosthetic provides these benefits:

* The prosthetic is a fully capable part of your body.
* You can take an action to remove the prosthetic, and it removes itself if your attunement to it ends. It can't be removed against your will.
* The prosthetic is a magic melee weapon with which you're proficient. It deals 1d8 force damage on a hit and has the thrown property, with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When thrown, the prosthetic detaches and flies at the target of the attack, then immediately returns to you and reattaches.

Once the rune has been invoked, it can’t be invoked again until the next dawn.

## Arrow of Slaying
Weapon
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Weapon (arrow), very rare*

An *arrow of slaying* is a magic weapon meant to slay a particular kind of creature. Some are more focused than others; for example, there are both *arrows of dragon slaying* and *arrows of blue dragon slaying*. If a creature belonging to the type, race, or group associated with an *arrow of slaying* takes damage from the arrow, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one.

Once an *arrow of slaying* deals its extra damage to a creature, it becomes a nonmagical arrow.

Other types of magic ammunition of this kind exist, such as *bolts of slaying* meant for a crossbow, though arrows are most common.

## Bag of Devouring
Wondrous Item
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, very rare*

This bag superficially resembles a bag of holding but is a feeding orifice for a gigantic extradimensional creature. Turning the bag inside out closes the orifice.

The extradimensional creature attached to the bag can sense whatever is placed inside the bag. Animal or vegetable matter placed wholly in the bag is devoured and lost forever. When part of a living creature is placed in the bag, as happens when someone reaches inside it, there is a 50 percent chance that the creature is pulled inside the bag. A creature inside the bag can use its action to try to escape with a successful DC 15 Strength check. Another creature can use its action to reach into the bag to pull a creature out, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength check (provided it isn't pulled inside the bag first). Any creature that starts its turn inside the bag is devoured, its body destroyed.

Inanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which can hold a cubic foot of such material. However, once each day, the bag swallows any objects inside it and spits them out into another plane of existence. The DM determines the time and plane.

If the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and anything contained within it is transported to a random location on the Astral Plane.

## Baleful Talon
Weapon
Source: The Book of Many Things

*Weapon (dagger), very rare*

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this hooked, obsidian dagger.

When you hit a creature with this magic weapon and roll a 19 or 20 on the attack roll, the creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw as the dagger flares with sickly light. The creature takes 6d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, the creature disintegrates into dust.

## Barrier Tattoo
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything

*Wondrous item (tattoo), rarity varies (requires attunement)*

**Tattoo Attunement.** To attune to this item, you hold the needle to your skin where you want the tattoo to appear, pressing the needle there throughout the attunement process. When the attunement is complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the skin.

If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo vanishes, and the needle reappears in your space.

**Protection.** While you aren't wearing armor, the tattoo grants you an Armor Class depending on the tattoo's rarity, as shown below. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.

| Rarity  |                     AC                     |

## Belt of Giant Strength
Wondrous Item (Attuned)

While wearing this belt, your Strength score changes to a score granted by the belt. If your Strength is already equal to or greater than the belt's score, the item has no effect on you.

Six varieties of this belt exist, corresponding with and having rarity according to the six kinds of true giants. The *Belt of Stone Giant Strength* and the *Belt of Frost Giant Strength* look different, but they have the same effect.

*Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)*

When you attack a creature with this magic weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, the creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw in addition to suffering the attack’s normal effects. On a failed save, the creature is restrained and must make another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves against this effect three times, the effect ends. If it fails its saves three times, it is turned to stone and subjected to the petrified condition for 1 hour.

A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to damage of the weapon’s type, does not have a body made of flesh, or has legendary actions.

***Curse.*** This weapon is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. Until the curse is broken with a [Remove Curse](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:remove-curse) spell or similar magic, you are unwilling to part with the weapon. Whenever you attack a creature with this weapon and roll a 1 on the attack roll, you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be restrained and forced to make additional saves against being petrified, as above.

***Curse.*** The bracelet's affinity with earth manifests as an unusual curse. Creatures of flesh that are strongly related to earth and stone, such as stone giants and dwarves, have advantage on the saving throw against [Flesh to Stone](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:flesh-to-stone) cast from the bracelet. If such a creature's save is successful, the bracelet breaks your attunement to it and casts the spell on you. You make your saving throw with disadvantage, and on a failed save you are petrified instantly.

## Candle of Invocation
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*

This slender taper is dedicated to a deity and shares that deity's alignment. The candle's alignment can be detected with the [Detect Good and Evil](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:detect-evil-and-good) spell. The DM chooses the god and associated alignment or determines the alignment randomly.

| d20 |   Alignment   |
|-----|---------------|
| 1-2 | Chaotic evil  |
| 3-4 |Chaotic neutral|
| 5-7 | Chaotic good  |
| 8-9 | Neutral evil  |
|10-11|    Neutral    |
|12-13| Neutral good  |
|14-15|  Lawful evil  |
|16-17|Lawful neutral |
|18-20|  Lawful good  |

The candle's magic is activated when the candle is lit, which requires an action. After burning for 4 hours, the candle is destroyed. You can snuff it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned in increments of 1 minute from the candle's total burn time.

While lit, the candle sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius. Any creature within that light whose alignment matches that of the candle makes attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks with advantage. In addition, a cleric or druid in the light whose alignment matches the candle's can cast 1st-level spells he or she has prepared without expending spell slots, though the spell's effect is as if cast with a 1st-level slot.

Alternatively, when you light the candle for the first time, you can cast the [Gate](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:gate) spell with it. Doing so destroys the candle.

## Cape of Enlargement
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Phandelver and Below - The Shattered Obelisk

*Wondrous Item, very rare (requires attunement)*

Ancient runes are stitched in silver thread along the hem of this grayish-purple cape.

The cape has 3 charges. As a bonus action while wearing the cape, you can expend 1 of its charges to enlarge yourself, granting yourself the following benefits:

* Your size increases by one category—from Medium to Large, for example. If there isn’t enough room for your size to increase by one category, you instead become the maximum possible size in the space available.
* You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
* When you hit with an attack roll using a weapon or an unarmed strike, you can add your proficiency bonus to the attack’s damage.

These benefits last for 10 minutes or until you use another bonus action to dismiss them. The cape regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.

## Carpet of Flying
Wondrous Item
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, very rare*

You can speak the carpet's command word as an action to make the carpet hover and fly. It moves according to your spoken directions, provided that you are within 30 feet of it.

Four sizes of *carpet of flying* exist. The DM chooses the size of a given carpet or determines it randomly.

| d100 |    Size     |Capacity|Flying Speed|
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
|01-20 |3 ft. X 5 ft.|200 lb. |  80 feet   |
|21-55 |4 ft. X 6 ft.|400 lb. |  60 feet   |
|56-80 |5 ft. X 7 ft.|600 lb. |  40 feet   |
|81-100|6 ft. X 9 ft.|800 lb. |  30 feet   |

A carpet can carry up to twice the weight shown on the table, but it flies at half speed if it carries more than its normal capacity.

## Cauldron of Rebirth
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything

*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a druid or warlock)*

This Tiny pot bears relief scenes of heroes on its cast iron sides. You can use the cauldron as a spell casting focus for your spells, and it functions as a suitable component for the [Scrying](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:scrying) spell. When you finish a long rest, you can use the cauldron to create a [Potion of Greater Healing](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:potion-of-healing). The potion lasts for 24 hours, then loses its magic if not consumed.

As an action, you can cause the cauldron to grow large enough for a Medium creature to crouch within. You can revert the cauldron to its normal size as an action, harmlessly shunting anything that can't fit inside to the nearest unoccupied space.

If you place the corpse of a humanoid into the cauldron and cover the corpse with 200 pounds of salt (which costs 10 gp) for at least 8 hours, the salt is consumed and the creature returns to life as if by [Raise Dead](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:raise-dead) at the next dawn. Once used, this property can't be used again for 7 days.

## Chime of Exile
Wondrous Item
Source: Vecna - Eve of Ruin

*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*

This silver chime is engraved with delicate magic sigils. While holding the chime, you can use an action to cast the [Banishment](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:banishment) spell (spell save DC 20). If the target of the spell has 50 hit points or fewer, it automatically fails its saving throw. Once the chime has been used to cast the spell, it can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.

## Chronolometer
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Acquisitions Incorporated

*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*

While attuned to this device, you have a +1 bonus to Intelligence saving throws. The first time you attune to the chronolometer, you choose one language you don't know. You subsequently know that language while attuned to the device.

***Time Bandit.*** At the start of your turn, roll a d6 (no action required). On a 1-3, you slow down time, gaining an additional action on your turn and doubling your speed until the end of the turn. On a 4-6, you go forward in time to warn yourself of what is to come. The next time you fail a saving throw, attack roll, or ability check, you can reroll the check and take either result. Once you use this feature of the chronolometer, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.

***Fate Swap.*** As a reaction when a creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, that creature gains an additional action if it is the creature's turn, or can take an action immediately even though it isn't the creature's turn. Once you use this feature of the chronolometer, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.

***Part of a Whole.*** While this component is not installed in the *[Orrery of the Wanderer](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:orrery-of-the-wanderer)*, its magic might function sporadically or with unpredictable side effects, as determined by the DM.

## Cloak of Arachnida
Wondrous Item (Attuned)

*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*

This fine garment is made of black silk interwoven with faint silvery threads. While wearing it, you gain the following benefits:

* You have resistance to poison damage.

* You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.

* You can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free.

* You can't be caught in webs of any sort and can move through webs as if they were difficult terrain.

* You can use an action to cast the [Web](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:web) spell (save DC 13). The web created by the spell fills twice its normal area. Once used, this property of the cloak can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Clockwork Armor
Armor (Attuned)

*Armor (heavy), very rare (requires attunement)*

The outside surface and internal joints of this armor whir with interlocking gears, drawing on the orderly magic of the plane of Mechanus.

The armor has 4 charges. If you make a d20 roll while wearing this armor, you can expend 1 charge to change the number rolled to a 10. The armor regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn.

## Conch of Teleportation
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Storm King's Thunder

*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*

This item is an ordinary, albeit rather large, conch shell that has been inscribed with the uvar rune. The conch measures 2 1/2 feet long and weighs 20 pounds.

As an action, you can cast the [Teleport](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:teleport) spell by blowing into the shell. The destination is fixed, and there is no chance of either a mishap or the spell being off target. Anyone teleported by the conch appears in a specific location designated by the item's creator at the time the uvar rune is inscribed on the conch. It doesn't allow teleportation to any other destination. Once its spell is cast, the conch can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Constantori's Portrait
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Keys from the Golden Vault

*Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)*

This painting by famed artist Dkesii Kwan depicts Constantori, a beautiful courtier, who was paid a staggering sum to be Dkesii's model. Whether Constantori's actual appearance matches the painting remains a subject of debate. The portrait is one of several paintings commissioned by the late Daiyani Grysthorn, a crime lord who frequently gave magical paintings as gifts to her most esteemed associates.

***Sentience.*** *Constantori's Portrait* is a sentient, lawful evil item with an Intelligence score of 14, a Wisdom score of 12, and a Charisma score of 8. It can hear within a range of 120 feet and has darkvision within a range of 60 feet, but it can't see anything behind itself.

The painting can converse in Common, Draconic, and Elvish as if it were a living person, though Constantori's mouth doesn't move. Whenever conversation occurs within the portrait's auditory range, the painting eagerly gathers secrets, the names of secret tellers, significant events, or any political conversations.

***Personality.*** *Constantori's Portrait* is demanding, condescending, and vain. It doesn't like being covered or placed out of sight, and it loudly condemns anyone who tries to remove it from its gold-leaf frame.

***Wealth of Information.*** The painting's primary purpose is to observe and recall conversations. Over the past few decades, *Constantori's Portrait* has quietly observed countless conversations and now possesses an unquantifiable amount of lore—everything from criminal conspiracies to secret passwords. The DM decides what the painting knows and what it doesn't.

While attuned to the painting, you can take an action to telepathically contact it over any distance, provided you and the painting are on the same plane of existence. The painting can't telepathically contact you, however. Maintaining telepathic contact with the painting requires your concentration (as if concentrating on a spell).

***Guardian Portrait.*** While you are attuned to the painting, you can command it to guard its location against one or more creatures you identify as the painting's enemies. The painting performs this function until you command it to stop or until your attunement to the painting ends.

The painting has 3 charges. When a creature the painting identifies as its enemy starts its turn in a space the painting can see, the painting expends 1 of its charges to cast [Magic Missile](/spell:magic-missile) (3 missiles), targeting that creature. The painting regains all expended charges daily at dawn.

The painting is a Small object with AC 12, 20 hit points, and immunity to poison damage. In its gold-leaf frame, the painting weighs 15 pounds. If the painting has at least 1 hit point and is targeted by a [Mending](/spell:mending) spell, it regains 2d6 hit points.

## Crown Of Whirling Comets

*Wondrous Item, very rare (requires attunement)*

This delicate silver tiara is decorated with stellar iconography. While you wear the crown, the gems on the tiara’s points detach and closely orbit your head.

The crown has 6 charges for the following properties, which you can use while wearing the crown:

**Star Flight.** As a bonus action, you can spend 1 charge to gain the power of flight for 10 minutes. For the duration, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed, and you can hover. While flying, you glow faintly with starlight.

**Starlight Strike.** As an action, you can spend any number of charges to launch bolts of frigid starlight. You launch a number of bolts equal to the number of charges spent, and you can direct the bolts to target one creature or several, so long as all creatures are within 120 feet of you and you can see them. The bolts automatically strike their targets, and each bolt deals 2d4 cold damage.

**Whirling Hail.** As an action, you can spend 3 charges and cast the [Ice Storm](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:ice-storm) spell (save DC 16).

The crown regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.

## Crystal Ball

*Wondrous item, very rare or legendary (requires attunement)*

The typical *crystal ball*, a very rare item, is about 6 inches in diameter. While touching it, you can cast the [Scrying](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:scrying) spell (save DC 17) with it.

The following *crystal ball* variants are legendary items and have additional properties.

***Crystal Ball of Mind Reading.*** You can use an action to cast the [Detect Thoughts](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:detect-thoughts) spell (save DC 17) while you are scrying with the crystal ball, targeting creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor. You don't need to concentrate on this [Detect Thoughts](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:detect-thoughts) to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if scrying ends.

***Crystal Ball of Telepathy.*** While scrying with the crystal ball, you can communicate telepathically with creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor. You can also use an action to cast the [Suggestion](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:suggestion) spell (save DC 17) through the sensor on one of those creatures. You don't need to concentrate on this [Suggestion](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:suggestion) to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if scrying ends. Once used, the [Suggestion](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:suggestion) power of the *crystal ball* can't be used again until the next dawn.

***Crystal Ball of True Seeing.*** While scrying with the crystal ball, you have truesight with a radius of 120 feet centered on the spell's sensor.

## Crystalline Chronicle
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything

*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a wizard)*

An etched crystal sphere the size of a grapefruit hums faintly and pulses with irregular flares of inner light. While you are touching the crystal, you can retrieve and store information and spells within the crystal at the same rate as reading and writing. When found, the crystal contains the following spells: [Detect Thoughts](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:detect-thoughts), [Intellect Fortress](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:intellect-fortress), [Rary's Telepathic Bond](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:rarys-telepathic-bond), [Sending](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:sending), [Telekinesis](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:telekinesis), [Tasha's Mind Whip](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:tashas-mind-whip), and [Tenser's Floating Disk](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:tensers-floating-disk). It functions as a spellbook for you, with its spells and other writing psychically encoded within it.

While you are holding the crystal, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells, and you know the [Mage Hand](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:mage-hand), [Mind Sliver](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:mind-sliver), and [Message](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:message) cantrips if you don't already know them.

The crystal has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:

* If you spend 1 minute studying the information within the crystal, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book.
* When you cast a wizard spell, you can expend 1 charge to cast the spell without verbal, somatic, or material components of up to 100 gp value.

## Dancing Sword
Weapon (Attuned)
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)*

You can use a bonus action to toss this magic sword into the air and speak the command word. When you do so, the sword begins to hover, flies up to 30 feet, and attacks one creature of your choice within 5 feet of it. The sword uses your attack roll and ability score modifier to damage rolls.

While the sword hovers, you can use a bonus action to cause it to fly up to 30 feet to another spot within 30 feet of you. As part of the same bonus action, you can cause the sword to attack one creature within 5 feet of it.

After the hovering sword attacks for the fourth time, it flies up to 30 feet and tries to return to your hand. If you have no hands free, it falls to the ground at your feet. If the sword has no unobstructed path to you, it moves as close to you as it can and then falls to the ground. It also ceases to hover if you grasp it or move more than 30 feet away from it.

## Deck Of Dimensions
Wondrous Item
Source: The Book of Many Things

*Wondrous Item, very rare (requires attunement)*

The backs of the cards in this deck are decorated with intricate designs representing different planes of existence. The deck has 6 charges. While holding it, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to use the following properties:

**Marked Card.** As a bonus action, you can expend 1 charge to draw a card from the deck and place it in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. The card then becomes marked with an invisible sigil. Once within the next 24 hours, as an action, you can speak the marked card’s name and teleport to the card’s location, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying, appearing in the closest unoccupied space to the card. After you teleport in this way, or after 8 hours, the card returns to the deck, and the mark on it fades.

**Riffling Portal.** As an action, you can expend 3 charges to cast the [Arcane Gate](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:arcane-gate) spell from the deck. The deck vanishes, and fluttering cards create the spell’s portal rings. When the spell ends, the deck reappears in your possession.

**Shuffling Stride.** As a bonus action, you can expend 1 charge to throw a card from the deck to an unoccupied space within 60 feet of yourself and teleport, along with any equipment you’re wearing or carrying, to that space. The card then vanishes and returns to the deck.

The deck regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.

*Wondrous Item, very rare*

This deck of heavy vellum cards hums with the magic of the Elemental Chaos.

The magic of the deck functions only if cards are drawn at random (a deck of real-world playing cards can simulate the deck). As an action, you can draw a random card from this deck and throw it to make a ranged spell attack, using Dexterity for the attack roll. The card has a range of 30 feet. On a hit, it deals 1d4 slashing damage and imposes a magical effect determined by its suit, as detailed in the Deck of Wild Cards table. The card immediately returns to the deck after it hits or misses a target.

**Curse.** Once you don this cursed armor, you can't doff it unless you are targeted by the [Remove Curse](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:remove-curse) spell or similar magic. While wearing the armor, you have disadvantage on attack rolls against demons and on saving throws against their spells and special abilities.

## Devastation Orb
Wondrous Item
Source: Princes of the Apocalypse

*Wondrous item, very rare*

A *Devastation Orb* is an elemental bomb that can be created at the site of an elemental node by performing a ritual with an elemental weapon. The type of orb created depends on the node used. For example, an air node creates a *Devastation Orb of Air*. The ritual takes 1 hour to complete and requires 2,000 gp worth of special components, which are consumed.

A *Devastation Orb* measures 12 inches in diameter, weighs 10 pounds, and has a solid outer shell. The orb detonates 1d100 hours after its creation, releasing the elemental energy it contains. The orb gives no outward sign of how much time remains before it will detonate. Spells such as [Identify](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:identify) and [Divination](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:divination) can be used to ascertain when the orb will explode. An orb has AC 10, 15 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Reducing it to 0 hit points causes it to explode instantly.

A special container can be crafted to contain a *Devastation Orb* and prevent it from detonating. The container must be inscribed with symbols of the orb’s opposing element. For example, a case inscribed with earth symbols can be used to contain a *Devastation Orb of Air* and keep it from detonating. While in the container, the orb thrums. If it is removed from the container after the time when it was supposed to detonate, it explodes 1d6 rounds later, unless it is returned to the container.

Regardless of the type of orb, its effect is contained within a sphere with a 1 mile radius. The orb is the sphere’s point of origin. The orb is destroyed after one use.

***Air Orb.*** When this orb detonates, it creates a powerful windstorm that lasts for 1 hour. Whenever a creature ends its turn exposed to the wind, the creature must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage, as the wind and debris batter it. The wind is strong enough to uproot weak trees and destroy light structures after at least 10 minutes of exposure. Otherwise, the rules for strong wind apply, as detailed in chapter 5 of the *Dungeon Master’s Guide*.

***Earth Orb.*** When this orb detonates, it subjects the area to the effects of the [Earthquake](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:earthquake) spell for 1 minute (spell save DC 18). For the purpose of the spell’s effects, the spell is cast on the turn that the orb explodes.

***Fire Orb.*** When this orb detonates, it creates a dry heat wave that lasts for 24 hours. Within the area of effect, the rules for extreme heat apply, as detailed in chapter 5 of the *Dungeon Master’s Guide*. At the end of each hour, there is a ten percent chance that the heat wave starts a wildfire in a random location within the area of effect. The wildfire covers a 10-foot-square area initially but expands to fill another 10-foot square each round until the fire is extinguished or burns itself out. A creature that comes within 10 feet of a wildfire for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 3d6 fire damage.

***Water Orb.*** When this orb detonates, it creates a torrential rainstorm that lasts for 24 hours. Within the area of effect, the rules for heavy precipitation apply, as detailed in chapter 5 of the *Dungeon Master’s Guide*. If there is a substantial body of water in the area, it floods after 2d10 hours of heavy rain, rising 10 feet above its banks and inundating the surrounding area. The flood advances at a rate of 100 feet per round, moving away from the body of water where it began until it reaches the edge of the area of effect: at that point, the water flows downhill (and possibly recedes back to its origin). Light structures collapse and wash away. Any Large or smaller creature caught in the flood’s path is swept away. The flooding destroys crops and might trigger mudslides, depending on the terrain.

## Dimensional Loop
Wondrous Item (Attuned)

*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*

While attuned to this device, you have a +1 bonus to Strength saving throws. and you have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, its range increases by 30 feet.

***Dimensional Cloak.*** As a bonus action, you send your body out of phase with the material world for 1 minute, granting you advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide, and imposing disadvantage on attack rolls against you. Once you use this feature of the dimensional loop, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.

***Fold Space.*** Choose a space you can see within 60 feet of you (no action required). You treat that space as if it were within 5 feet of you until the end of your turn. This allows you to move immediately to that space without provoking opportunity attacks, or to interact with objects or creatures in that space as though they were next to you (including allowing you to make melee attacks into that space). Once you use this feature of the dimensional loop, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.

***Part of a Whole.*** While this component is not installed in the *[Orrery of the Wanderer](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:orrery-of-the-wanderer)*, its magic might function sporadically or with unpredictable side effects, as determined by the DM.

*Wondrous item, very rare*

This smooth, rainbow-colored, egg-shaped stone can be thrown up to 30 feet and explodes in a 10-foot-radius sphere of magical energy on impact, destroying the stone. Any active spell of 5th level or lower in the sphere ends.

## Dragon Scale Mail
Armor (Attuned)
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Armor (scale mail), very rare (requires attunement)*

Dragon scale mail is made of the scales of one kind of dragon. Sometimes dragons collect their cast-off scales and gift them to humanoids. Other times, hunters carefully skin and preserve the hide of a dead dragon. In either case, dragon scale mail is highly valued.

While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, you have advantage on saving throws against the Frightful Presence and breath weapons of dragons, and you have resistance to one damage type that is determined by the kind of dragon that provided the scales (see the table).

Additionally, you can focus your senses as an action to magically discern the distance and direction to the closest dragon within 30 miles of you that is of the same type as the armor. This special action can't be used again until the next dawn.

Once the item is used to cast a given spell, it can’t be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells are determined by the family of the dragon in whose hoard it became Wakened.

## Dyrrn's Tentacle Whip
Weapon (Attuned)
Source: Eberron - Rising from the Last War

*Weapon (whip), very rare (requires attunement)*

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic whip, but attack rolls made against aberrations with this weapon have disadvantage. A creature hit by this weapon takes an extra 1d6 psychic damage. When you roll a 20 on the d20 for an attack roll with this weapon, the target is stunned until the end of its next turn.

your arm again.

***Symbiotic Nature.*** The whip can't be removed from you while you're attuned to it, and you can't voluntarily end your attunement to it. If you're targeted by a spell that ends a curse, your attunement to the whip ends, and it detaches from you.

## Efreeti Bottle
Wondrous Item
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

This painted brass bottle weighs 1 pound. When you use an action to remove the stopper, a cloud of thick smoke flows out of the bottle. At the end of your turn, the smoke disappears with a flash of harmless fire, and an efreeti appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. See the *Monster Manual* for the efreeti's statistics.

**Eldritch Escape.** If you take damage while holding the staff, you can use your reaction to expend 3 of the staff's charges, whereupon you turn invisible and teleport yourself, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. You remain invisible until the start of your next turn or until you attack, cast a spell, or deal damage.

## Figurine of Wondrous Power
Wondrous Item
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide, Fizban's Treasury of Dragons

*Wondrous item, rarity by figurine*

A *Figurine of Wondrous Power* is a statuette of a beast small enough to fit in a pocket. If you use an action to speak the command word and throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the figurine becomes a living creature. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn't become a creature.

The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions. See the *Monster Manuel* for the creature's statistics.

The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine's description.

***Bronze Griffon (Rare).*** This bronze statuette is of a griffon rampant. It can become a **griffon** for up to 6 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 5 days have passed.

***Ebony Fly (Rare).*** This ebony statuette is carved in the likeness of a horsefly. It can become a **giant fly** for up to 12 hours and can be ridden as a mount. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed.

***Golden Lions (Rare).*** These gold statuettes of lions are always created in pairs. You can use one figurine or both simultaneously. Each can become a **lion** for up to 1 hour. Once a lion has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

***Ivory Goats (Rare).*** These ivory statuettes of goats are always created in sets of three. Each goat looks unique and functions differently from the others. Their properties are as follows

* The *goat of traveling* can become a **Large goat** with the same statistics as a **riding horse**. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in beast form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can't be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all its charges.

* The *goat of travail* becomes a **giant goat** for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 30 days have passed.

* The *goat of terror* becomes a **giant goat** for up to 3 hours. The goat can't attack, but you can remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes a *+1 lance*, and the other becomes a *+2 longsword*. Removing a horn requires an action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form. In addition, the goat radiates a 30-foot-radius aura of terror while you are riding it. Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the goat for 1 minute, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it successfully saves against the effect, a creature is immune to the goat's aura for the net 24 hours. Once the figurine has been used, it can't be used again until 15 days have passed.

***Marble Elephant (Rare).*** This marble statuette is about 4 inches high and long. It can become an **elephant** for up to 24 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

***Obsidian Steed (Very Rare).*** This polished obsidian horse can become a **nightmare** for up to 24 hours. The nightmare fights only to defend itself. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 5 days have passed.

If you have a good alignment, the figurine has a 10 percent chance each time you use it to ignore your orders, including a command to revert to figurine form. If you mount the nightmare while it is ignoring your orders, you and the nightmare are instantly transported to a random location on the plane of Hades, where the nightmare reverts to figurine form.

***Onyx Dog (Rare).*** This onyx statuette of a dog can become a **mastiff** for up to 6 hours. The mastiff has an Intelligence of 8 and can speak Common. It also has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet and can see invisible creatures and objects within that range. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

***Serpentine Owl (Rare).*** This serpentine statuette of an owl can become a **giant owl** for up to 8 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed. The owl can telepathically communicate with you at any range if you and it are on the same plane of existence.

***Silver Raven (Uncommon).*** This silver statuette of a raven can become a **raven** for up to 12 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed. While in raven form, the figurine allows you to cast the [Animal Messenger](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:animal-messenger) spell on it at will.

In addition, the following *Figurine of Wondrous Power* was added in *Fizban's Treasury of Dragons:*

***Gold Canary (Legendary)***  
*Giant Canary Form.* The figurine becomes a giant canary (see the accompanying stat block) for up to 8 hours and can be ridden as a mount. Once the figurine has become a giant canary, it can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.  
*Gold Dragon Form.* While you are missing half or more of your hit points, you can speak a different command word and the figurine becomes an adult gold dragon for up to 1 hour. The dragon can’t use any legendary actions or lair actions. Once the figurine has become an adult gold dragon, it can’t be used this way again until 1 year has passed.

## Fish Suit
Wondrous Item
Source: Spelljammer: Adventures in Space - Astral Adventurer's Guide

*Wondrous item, Very Rare*

This bulky suit, which fully encases your head and body, takes 1 minute to don or doff. While worn, it enables you to breathe in an airless environment and renders you immune to the harmful effects of any gas that surrounds you. The suit also grants you a swimming speed equal to your walking speed while underwater, or a flying speed equal to your walking speed in an environment with no gravity.

## Flying Citadel Helm
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Dragonlance: Shadow of the Dragon Queen

*Wondrous item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement by a Spellcaster)*

The function of this ornate chair is to propel and maneuver a flying citadel on which it has been installed. The chair has an AC 15, 18 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. It is destroyed if reduced to 0 hit points.

The sensation of being attuned to a flying citadel helm is akin to the pins-and-needles effect one experiences after one's arm or leg falls asleep, but not as intense.

While attuned to a *flying citadel helm* and sitting in it, you gain the following abilities for as long as you maintain concentration (as if concentrating on a spell):

* You can use the *flying citadel helm* to move the citadel through the air up to 80 feet per round, or up to 8 miles per hour.

* You can steer the citadel, albeit in a somewhat clumsy fashion, in much the way a rudder or oars can be used to maneuver a seafaring ship.

* At any time, you can see and hear from the highest point outside the citadel as though you were that location.

If no creature attuned to the helm is maintaining concentration, the citadel remains motionless in its space.

***Transfer Attunement.*** You can use an action or bonus action to touch a willing spellcaster, whereupon that creature attunes to the *flying citadel helm* immediately, and your attunement to the *flying citadel helm* ends.

***Crash.*** Should the *flying citadel helm* be destroyed, the citadel it is installed on loses power and begins to crumble. If the crumbling citadel is in the air, it descends at a rate of 30 feet per round, or 300ft per minute. Any creature on the citadel or on the ground within 120 feet of the citadel when it lands must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 39 (6d12) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Fool's Blade
Weapon (Attuned)

*Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)*

This weapon appears ordinary, but it bears strong illusion magic that allows its wielder to skillfully deceive opponents.

You have a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While wielding it, you also gain the following benefits:

**Fool’s Feint.** As a bonus action, you can feint, choosing a creature within 5 feet of you as your target. Until the start of your next turn, you have advantage on attack rolls against the target. Once this bonus action is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

**Misdirect.** When a creature within 60 feet of you targets you with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to require that creature to make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the attack instead targets another creature of your choice that is within the attacker’s reach. Once this reaction has been used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

## Ghost Step Tattoo
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything

*Wondrous item (tattoo), very rare (requires attunement)*

Produced by a special needle, this tattoo shifts and wavers on the skin, parts of it appearing blurred.

**Tattoo Attunement.** To attune to this item, you hold the needle to your skin where you want the tattoo to appear, pressing the needle there throughout the attunement process. When the attunement is complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the skin.

If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo vanishes, and the needle reappears in your space.

**Ghostly Form.** The tattoo has 3 charges, and it regains all expended charges daily at dawn. As a bonus action while the tattoo is on your skin, you can expend 1 of the tattoo's charges to become incorporeal until the end of your next turn. For the duration, you gain the following benefits:

* You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.

* You can't be grappled or restrained.

* You can move through creatures and solid objects as if they were difficult terrain. If you end your turn in a solid object, you take 1d10 force damage. If the effect ends while you are inside a solid object, you instead are shunted to the nearest unoccupied space, and you take 1d10 force damage for every 5 feet traveled.

## Guild Keyrune
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica

*Wondrous item, rarity by keyrune (requires attunement by a member of the relevant guild)*

Associated with a particular guild, a *guild keyrune* is a ceremonial, stylized key, about 1 foot long, made from carved stone. Not a literal key, the item is a badge of authority that gives its bearer access to privileged places in its guild's headquarters and outposts. At the DM's discretion, a character might be given a keyrune upon attaining a renown score of 25 in their guild.

When you use an action to speak the item's command word and place the keyrune on the ground in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, the keyrune transforms into a creature. If there isn't enough space for the creature, the keyrune doesn't transform. See the *Monster Manual* for the creature's stat block — the name of which is given in bold in the keyrune's description — unless you're directed to chapter 6 of this book instead.

The creature is friendly to you, your companions, and other members of your guild (unless those guild members are hostile to you). It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature takes the Dodge action and moves to avoid danger.

The creature exists for a duration specific to each keyrune. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its keyrune form. It reverts early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature reverts to its keyrune form, it can't transform again until 36 hours have passed.

***Azorius Keyrune (Rare).*** This keyrune is carved from white marble and lapis lazuli to resemble a noble bird of prey. It can become a **giant eagle** for up to 1 hour. While the transformed eagle is within l mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. As an action, you can see through the eagle's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, and you gain the benefit of its keen sight. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.

***Boros Keyrune (Rare).*** Carved from red sandstone with white granite elements to resemble a member of the Boros Legion, this keyrune can become a **veteran** (human) for up to 8 hours. In addition to fighting on your behalf, this veteran cheerfully offers tactical advice, which is usually sound. Anyone who talks with the transformed keyrune or examines it closely can easily recognize that it is an artificial human.

***Dimir Keyrune (Very Rare).*** This keyrune, carved from black stone accented with steel, resembles a stylized horror. On command, it transforms into an **intellect devourer** that resembles the Dimir guild symbol, with six bladelike legs. The creature exists for up to 24 hours. During that time, it pursues only a single mission you give it — usually an assignment to take over someone's body, either to impersonate that person for a brief time or to extract secrets from their mind. When the mission is complete, the creature returns to you, reports its success, and reverts to its keyrune form.

***Golgari Keyrune (Very Rare).*** Made from deep green jade with black veins, this keyrune has an insectile shape. It can transform into a **giant scorpion** for up to 6 hours. The scorpion has an Intelligence of 4 and can communicate with you telepathically while it is within 60 feet of you, though its messages are largely limited to describing the passage of potential prey.

***Gruul Keyrune (Rare).*** This crude keyrune is cobbled together from bits of rubble, broken glass, bone, and animal hair. One end resembles a horned beast. On command, the keyrune transforms into a ceratok, a horned creature much like a **rhinoceros** (and with the same statistics). It remains in its ceratok form for 1 hour.

***Izzet Keyrune (Rare).*** Formed of carved and polished red and blue stone, the keyrune includes bits of cable and wire. One end resembles a humanlike head, suggesting the jagged elemental form of the **galvanice weird** (see chapter 6 for the stat block) that it can become for a duration of 3 hours. In this form, it will serve you as a bodyguard, lift and carry things for you, act as a test subject for your experiments, or aid you in any other way that its capabilities allow.

***Orzhov Keyrune (Rare).*** This keyrune is carved from white marble with veins of black. The end is shaped like a thrull's head, with a gold faceplate affixed. On command, the keyrune transforms into a **winged thrull** (see chapter 6 for the stat block) for up to 2 hours. If you don't come from an Orzhov oligarch family, it serves you grudgingly, clownishly aping your movements and mannerisms while carrying out your orders.

***Rakdos Keyrune (Uncommon).*** This dark granite keyrune is marbled with scarlet veins and carved with the leering visage of a mischievous demon. When activated, it transforms into a **cackler** (see chapter 6 for the stat block) for up to 1 hour.

***Selesnya Keyrune (Rare).*** Carved from white and green marble in the shape of a wolf's head, this keyrune transforms into a **dire wolf**. The wolf persists for 8 hours. Its Intelligence is 6, and it understands Elvish and Sylvan but can't speak those languages. While it is within 1 mile of you. you can communicate with each other telepathically.

***Simic Keyrune (Uncommon).*** This keyrune is assembled from coral, mother-of pearl, and chrome and adorned with the spirals and curves characteristic of Simic ornamentation. The head resembles the shell of a sea creature. On command, the keyrune turns into a **category 1 krasis** (see chapter 6 for the stat block) that has the Grabber and Stabilizing Legs adaptations. The transformation lasts for up to 5 hours.

## Hammer of Runic Focus
Weapon (Attuned)
Source: The Book of Many Things

*Weapon (warhammer), very rare (requires attunement)*

This magic hammer has 3 charges. As a bonus action, you can expend 1 charge and slam this hammer on the ground, creating a 15-foot-radius circle of glowing runes centered on the point of impact. While you’re inside that area, your hammer glows with matching runes, and you gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this hammer. The rune circle disappears after 1 minute, when you create another rune circle, or when you dismiss the rune circle as a bonus action. This hammer regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.

## Helm of Brilliance
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*

This dazzling helm is set with 1d10 diamonds, 2d10 rubies, 3d10 fire opals, and 4d10 opals. Any gem pried from the helm crumbles to dust. When all the gems are removed or destroyed, the helm loses its magic.

You gain the following benefits while wearing it:

* You can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18), using one of the helm's gems of the specified type as a component: [Daylight](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:daylight) (opal), [Fireball](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:fireball) (fire opal), [Prismatic Spray](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:prismatic-spray) (diamond), or [Wall of Fire](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:wall-of-fire) (ruby). The gem is destroyed when the spell is cast and disappears from the helm.
* As long as it has at least one diamond, the helm emits dim light in a 30-foot radius when at least one undead is within that area. Any undead that starts its turn in that area takes 1d6 radiant damage.
* As long as the helm has at least one ruby, you have resistance to fire damage.
* As long as the helm has at least one fire opal, you can use an action and speak a command word to cause one weapon you are holding to burst into flames. The flames emit bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The flames are harmless to you and the weapon. When you hit with an attack using the blazing weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 fire damage. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or stow the weapon.

Roll a d20 if you are wearing the helm and take fire damage as a result of failing a saving throw against a spell. On a roll of 1, the helm emits beams of light from its remaining gems. Each creature within 60 feet of the helm other than you must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by a beam, taking radiant damage equal to the number of gems in the helm. The helm and its gems are then destroyed.

## Helm of Devil Command
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Baldur's Gate - Descent into Avernus

*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a creature that can speak Infernal)*

This bulky, eyeless helmet is made for a pit fiend but magically resizes to fit the heads of other wearers.

While wearing the helm, you can see out of it as though you weren't wearing it. In addition, you know the exact location and type of all devils within 1,000 feet of you. You can telepathically communicate with a devil within range, or you can broadcast your thoughts to all devils within range. The devils receiving your broadcasted thoughts have no special means of replying to them.

The helm has 3 charges. As an action, you can expend 1 charge to cast [Dominate Monster](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:dominate-monster) (save DC 21), which affects devils only. (The spell fails and the charge is wasted if you target any creature that's not a devil.) If a devil can see you when you cast this spell on it, the devil knows you tried to charm it. The helm regains all its charges 24 hours after its last charge is expended.

If you are not a devil, using the helm's [Dominate Monster](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:dominate-monster) property in the Nine Hells has a 20 percent chance of attracting a narzugon (see page 238), which arrives on the back of a nightmare mount in 1d4 hours. The narzugon tries to recover the helm, killing you if necessary to obtain it. If it gets the helm, the narzugon tries to deliver it to its infernal master.

## Heward's Hireling Armor
Armor (Attuned)
Source: Lost Laboratory of Kwalish

*Armor (leather), very rare (requires attunement)*

A number of Kwalish’s experiments were attempts to research the works of the legendary mage Heward, who first crafted what he named *Hireling Armor*. While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. In addition, the armor’s animated straps can assist with the drawing and sheathing of weapons, such that you can draw or stow two one-handed weapons when you would normally be able to draw or stow only one.

This armor also has six pockets, each of which is an extradimensional space. Each pocket can hold up to 20 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 2 cubic feet. The armor always weighs 10 pounds, regardless of its pockets’ contents. Placing an object into one of the armor’s pockets follows the normal rules for interacting with objects. Retrieving an item from a pocket of the armor requires you to use an action. When you reach into a pocket for a specific item, the item is always magically on top.

Placing the armor inside an extradimensional space created by a [Bag of Holding](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:bag-of-holding), a [Heward’s Handy Haversack](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:hewards-handy-haversack), or a similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t be reopened.

## Horn of Valhalla
Wondrous Item
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, rare (silver or brass), very rare (bronze), or legendary (iron)*

You can use an action to blow this horn. In response, warrior spirits from the plane of Ysgard appear within 60 feet of you. These spirits use the berserker statistics from the *Monster Manual*. They return to Ysgard after 1 hour or when they drop to 0 hit points. Once you use the horn, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

Four types of *horn of Valhalla* are known to exist, each made of a different metal. The horn's type determines how many berserkers answer its summons, as well as the requirement for its use. The DM chooses the horn's type or determines it randomly.

|d100 |Horn Type|Berserkers Summoned|            Requirement             |
|-----|---------|-------------------|------------------------------------|
|01-40| Silver  |      2d4 + 2      |                None                |
|41-75|  Brass  |      3d4 + 3      |Proficiency with all simple weapons |
|76-90| Bronze  |      4d4 + 4      | Proficiency with all medium armor  |
|91-00|  Iron   |      5d4 + 5      |Proficiency with all martial weapons|

If you blow the horn without meeting its requirement, the summoned berserkers attack you. If you meet the requirement, they are friendly to you and your companions and follow your commands.

*Ring, very rare (requires attunement)*

Allows an attuned wearer to ignore Undermountain's magical restrictions (see "Alterations to Magic" in source).

## Horseshoes of a Zephyr
Wondrous Item
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, very rare*

These iron horseshoes come in a set of four. While all four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature, they allow the creature to move normally while floating 4 inches above the ground. This effect means the creature can cross or stand above nonsolid or unstable surfaces, such as water or lava. The creature leaves no tracks and ignores difficult terrain. In addition, the creature can move at normal speed for up to 12 hours a day without suffering exhaustion from a forced march.

## Hunter's Coat
Armor (Attuned)
Source: Explorer's Guide to Wildemount

*Armor (leather), very rare (requires attunement)*

You gain a +1 bonus to AC while wearing this armor.

The coat has 3 charges. When you hit a creature with an attack and that creature doesn't have all its hit points, you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra 1d10 necrotic damage to the target. The coat regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.

## Illusionist's Bracers
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica

*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*

A powerful illusionist of House Dimir originally developed these bracers. which enabled her to create multiple minor illusions at once. The bracers' power, though, extends far beyond illusions.

While wearing the bracers. whenever you cast a cantrip, you can use a bonus action on the same turn to cast that cantrip a second time.

## Ingot of the Skold Rune
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Storm King's Thunder

*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*

This appears to be a simple ingot of iron ore, about a foot long and a few inches across. Inspection of its surface reveals the faint, silvery outline of the skold (shield) rune. The ingot has the following properties, which work only while it's on your person.

***Runic Shield.*** You have a +1 bonus to AC.

***Shield Bond.*** As a bonus action, choose a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you, other than yourself. Until the end of your next turn, any damage the target takes is reduced to l, but you take half the damage prevented in this way. The damage you take can't be reduced in any way. Once you use this property, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

***Shield Ward.*** You can transfer the ingot's magic to a nonmagical item — a shield or a two-handed melee weapon — by tracing the skold rune there with your finger. The transfer takes 8 hours of work that requires the two items to be within 5 feet of each other. At the end, the ingot is destroyed, and the rune appears in silver on the chosen item, which gains a benefit based on its form:

* **Shield.** The shield is now a rare magic item that requires attunement. Its magic gives you a + 1 bonus to AC, and the first time after each of your long rests that damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you are instead reduced to 1 hit point. You must be wielding the shield to gain these benefits.
* **Weapon.** The weapon is now an uncommon magic weapon. It grants you a +1 bonus to AC while you're holding it.

## Instrument of the Bards
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement by a bard)*

An *instrument of the bards* is an exquisite example of its kind, superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a legendary bard college. The following table lists the spells common to all instruments, as well as the spells specific to each one and its rarity. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 2d4 psychic damage.

You can use an action to play the instrument and cast one of its spells. Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.

You can play the instrument while casting a spell that causes any of its targets to be charmed on a failed saving throw, thereby imposing disadvantage on the save. This effect applies only if the spell has a somatic or a material component.

|     Instrument     | Rarity  |                                                                                                                                                     Spells                                                                                                                                                     |

## Ioun Stone
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide, Lost Laboratory of Kwalish

*Wondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement)*

An *Ioun stone* is named after Ioun, a god of knowledge and prophecy revered on some worlds. Many types of *Ioun stone* exist, each type a distant combination of shape and color.

When you use an action to toss one of these stones into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance of 1d3 feet and confers a benefit to you. Thereafter, another creature must use an action to grasp or net the stone to separate it from you, either by making a successful attack roll against AC 24 or a successful DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. You can use an action to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect.

A stone has AC 24, 10 hit points, and resistance to all damage. It is considered to be an object that is being worn while it orbits your head.

***Absorption (Very Rare).*** While this pale lavender ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell of 4th level or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you

Once the stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can't cancel it.

***Agility (Very Rare).*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this deep red sphere orbits your head.

***Awareness (Rare).*** You can't be surprised while this dark blue rhomboid orbits your head.

***Fortitude (Very Rare).*** Your Constitution score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pink rhomboid orbits your head.

***Greater Absorption (Legendary).*** While this marbled lavender and green ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell of 8th level or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you.

Once the stone has canceled 50 levels of spells, it burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can't cancel it.

***Insight (Very Rare).*** Your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this incandescent blue sphere orbits your head.

***Intellect (Very Rare).*** Your Intelligence score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled scarlet and blue sphere orbits your head.

***Leadership (Very Rare).*** Your charisma score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled pink and green sphere orbits your head.

***Mastery (Legendary).*** Your proficiency bonus increases by 1 while this pale green prism orbits your head.

***Protection (Rare).*** You gain a +1 bonus to AC while this dusty rose prism orbits your head.

***Regeneration (Legendary).*** You regain 15 hit points at the end of each hour this pearly white spindle orbits your head, provided that you have at least 1 hit point.

***Reserve (Rare).*** This vibrant purple prism stores spells cast into it, holding them until you use them. The stone can store up to 3 levels worth of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d4-1 levels of stored spells chosen by the DM.

Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 3rd level into the stone by touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the stone. If the stone can't hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.

While this stone orbits your head, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the stone is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.

***Strength (Very Rare).*** Your Strength score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pale blue rhomboid orbits your head.

***Sustenance (Rare).*** You don't need to eat or drink while this clear spindle orbits your head.

In addition, the following *Ioun Stones* were introduced in the adventure *Lost Laboratory of Kwalish*:

***Historical Knowledge (Rare)*** You gain proficiency in the History skill, or a +1 bonus to checks with that skill if already proficient, while this polished, steely sphere orbits your head.

***Language Knowledge (Rare)*** You are fluent in one additional language while this pulsating bit of red jeweled crystal orbits your head. The DM chooses the language bestowed by the stone.

***Natural Knowledge (Rare)*** You gain proficiency in the Nature skill, or a +1 bonus to checks with that skill if already proficient, while this burnished, brassy stone orbits your head.

***Religious Knowledge (Rare)*** You gain proficiency in the Religion skill, or a +1 bonus to checks with that skill if already proficient, while this tiny golden gem orbits your head.

***Self-Preservation (Rare)*** You gain a +1 bonus to Intelligence saving throws while this silvery gem orbits your head.

***Supreme Intellect (Rare)*** You gain a +1 bonus to Intelligence checks while this faceted sphere orbits your head.

## Kyrzin's Ooze
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Eberron - Rising from the Last War

*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*

This opalescent, symbiotic goo comes sealed in a jar and slowly shifts and moves, as if endlessly exploring the jar's interior. To attune to this item, you must first drink the contents of the jar, unlocking the following properties.

***Resistant.*** While attuned to *Kyrzin's ooze*, you have resistance to poison and acid damage, and you're immune to the poisoned condition.

***Amorphous.*** As an action, you can speak a command word and cause your body to assume the amorphous qualities of an ooze. For the next minute, you (along with any equipment you're wearing or carrying) can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. Once you use this property, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

***Acid Breath.*** As an action, you can exhale acid in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once you use this property, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

***Symbiotic Nature.*** The ooze can't be removed from you while you're attuned to it, and you can't voluntarily end your attunement to it. If you're targeted by a spell that ends a curse, your attunement to the ooze ends, as it seeps out of you.

If you die while the ooze is inside you, it bursts out and engulfs you, turning your corpse into a black pudding allied with the daelkyr (see the *Monster Manual* for the black pudding's stat block).

Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything

*Wondrous item (tattoo), very rare (require attunement)*

Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo features symbols of life and rebirth.

**Tattoo Attunement.** To attune to this item, you hold the needle to your skin where you want the tattoo to appear, pressing the needle there throughout the attunement process. When the attunement is complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the skin.

If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo vanishes, and the needle reappears in your space.

**Necrotic Resistance.** You have resistance to necrotic damage.

**Life Ward.** When you would be reduced to 0 hit points, you drop to 1 hit point instead. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Living Armor
Armor (Attuned)
Source: Eberron - Rising from the Last War

*Armor (any), very rare (requires attunement)*

This hideous armor is formed from black chitin, beneath which veins pulse and red sinews glisten. To attune to this item, you must wear it for the entire attunement period, during which tendrils on the inside burrow into you.

While wearing this armor, you have a +1 bonus to Armor Class, and you have resistance to the following damage types: necrotic, poison, and psychic.

***Symbiotic Nature.*** The armor can't be removed from you while you're attuned to it, and you can't voluntarily end your attunement to it. If you're targeted by a spell that ends a curse, your attunement to the armor ends, and it detaches from you.

The armor requires fresh blood be fed to it. Immediately after you finish any long rest, you must either feed half of your remaining Hit Dice to the armor (round up) or take 1 level of exhaustion.

## Lord's Ensemble
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Waterdeep - Dragon Heist

*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a creature with a humanoid build)*

The Masked Lords of Waterdeep don this ensemble when meeting with one another. This raiment renders each lord indistinguishable from the others. The ensemble consists of three pieces — a helm, an amulet, and a robe — that function as a single magic item when worn together, but only within the city of Waterdeep and its sewers. You become attuned to the ensemble as a single item.

***Lord's Helm.*** This bucket helm covers your head and conceals your face. Screens over the eyes help to shroud your identity without blinding you. While you wear the helm, your voice is magically altered to sound genderless, and you are immune to magic that allows other creatures to read your thoughts, to determine whether you are lying, to know your alignment, or to know your creature type. Creatures can communicate telepathically with you only if you allow it.

***Lord's Amulet.*** This amulet bears the crest of Waterdeep. It functions as an [Amulet of Proof Against Detection and Location](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:amulet-of-proof-against-detection-and-location).

***Lord's Robe.*** This elegant robe functions as a [Ring of Free Action](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:ring-of-free-action), and it creates the illusion that you have a nondescript. androgynous humanoid build and stand 6 feet tall.

## Lucent Destroyer
Weapon (Attuned)

## Manual of Golems
Wondrous Item
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, very rare*

This tome contains information and incantations necessary to make a particular type of golem. The DM chooses the type or determines it randomly. To decipher and use the manual, you must be a spellcaster with at least two 5th-level spell slots. A creature that can't use a *manual of golems* and attempts to read it takes 6d6 psychic damage.

| d20 |Golem|  Time  |   Cost   |
|-----|-----|--------|----------|
| 1-5 |Clay |30 days |65,000 gp |

## Mindblasting Cap
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Phandelver and Below - The Shattered Obelisk

*Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)*

This soft, violet cap bears stitching in the pattern of folds on a brain.

As a bonus action while wearing the cap, you can project psychic energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 psychic damage and has the stunned condition for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only. At the end of each of its turns, a stunned creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the stunned condition on itself on a success.

Once this bonus action is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

## Mirror of Life Trapping
Wondrous Item
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, very rare*

When this 4-foot-tall mirror is viewed indirectly, its surface shows faint images of creatures. The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 11, 10 hit points, and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points.

If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet of it, you can use an action to speak its command word and activate it. It remains activated until you use an action to speak the command word again.

Any creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror's twelve extradimensional cells. This saving throw is made with advantage if the creature knows the mirror's nature, and constructs succeed on the saving throw automatically.

An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror's cells don't age, and they don't need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can escape using magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell until freed.

If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied spaces near it.

While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can use an action to speak the name of one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by number. The creature named or contained in the named cell appears as an image on the mirror's surface. You and the creature can then communicate normally.

In a similar way, you can use an action to speak a second command word and free one creature trapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears, along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest to the mirror and facing away from it.

## Mirror of Reflected Pasts
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Dragonlance: Shadow of the Dragon Queen

*Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)*

This mirror of elven design allows those who stare into it to reflect on positive memories. The 3-foot-tall mirror weighs 25 pounds, and it has AC 11, 10 hit points, and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is destroyed if reduced to 0 hit points.

While holding the mirror upright, you can use an action to speak its command word and activate it. While activated, the mirror hovers in the air, and it can be destroyed but not moved. It remains activated until you use an action to speak the command word again or your attunement to the mirror ends, at which the mirror harmlessly floats to the ground. Once the mirror has been deactivated, it can't be activated again until the next dawn.

If a non-Construct creature other than you sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of it, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become paralyzed until the mirror is deactivated or until the creature can no longer see the mirror. A creature paralyzed by the mirror can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to this mirror's effect for the next 24 hours.

While paralyzed by the mirror, the creature sees events from their past reflected in the mirror's glass. These memories aren't real, but rather idealized versions of those occurrences. Nearby observers can glimpse flashes of these memories if looking indirectly at the mirror.

## Mistral Mantle
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Bigby Presents - Glory of the Giants

*Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)*

This thick, fur-lined cloak has the frost rune stitched on the hem in silvery blue thread. Frigid wind swirls around the cloak, regardless of the weather.

While wearing this cloak, you have resistance to cold damage. Additionally, when you move within 5 feet of a creature, you can cause the cloak’s cold wind to buffet the creature. The creature must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 cold damage and have the prone condition. A creature can be affected by the mantle only once during a turn.

**Invoking the Rune.** As an action, you can invoke the mantle’s rune to cast the [Sleet Storm](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:sleet-storm) spell (save DC 14) with it. When you use the mantle to cast the spell, the area of the spell isn’t difficult terrain for you, and you can see through the storm, ignoring the normal penalties of a heavily obscured area.

Once the rune has been invoked, it can’t be invoked again until the next dawn.

## Moon Sickle
Weapon (Attuned)
Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything

*Weapon (sickle), uncommon (+1), rare (+2), very rare (+3) (requires attunement by a druid or ranger)*

This silver-bladed sickle glimmers softly with moonlight. While holding this magic weapon, you gain a bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it, and you gain a bonus to spell attack rolls and the saving throw DCs of your druid and ranger spells. The bonus is determined by the weapon's rarity. In addition, you can use the sickle as a spellcasting focus for your druid and ranger spells.

When you cast a spell that restores hit points, you can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the amount of hit points restored, provided you are holding the sickle.

## Mudslick Tower
Wondrous Item
Source: Phandelver and Below - The Shattered Obelisk

*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*

You can use an action to place this 1-inch-diameter granite sphere on the ground and speak its command word, which is “petrification” in Terran. The sphere rapidly grows into a stout tower that remains until you use an action to touch the tower and speak the command word again, whereupon the tower shrinks back to a 1-inch-diameter granite sphere. The tower must be empty to shrink in this way. The tower bristles with muddy knobs that constantly extrude and retract across its surface, as though the tower were breathing through a coating of thick mud.

Each creature in the area where the tower appears must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In either case, the creature is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the tower. Objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried take this damage and are pushed automatically.

Whenever it expands, the mudslick tower merges with any natural stone it touches, awkwardly tipping and wedging itself to touch as much natural stone as it can.

The tower is 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop it. Its interior is divided into two floors, with a ladder running along one wall to connect them. The ladder ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When activated, the tower has a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command, which you can speak as a bonus action. It is immune to the [Knock](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:knock) spell and similar magic, such as that of a [Chime of Opening](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:chime-of-opening).

Although it looks like stone, the tower is made of adamantine, and its magic prevents creatures from tipping it over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have 100 hit points, immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and resistance to all other damage. While merged with natural stone, the mudslick tower has immunity to all damage. Only a [Wish](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:wish) spell can repair the tower (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th level or lower). Each casting of [Wish](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:wish) causes the roof, the door, or one wall to regain 50 hit points.

## Navigation Orb
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Storm King's Thunder

*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*

A *Navigation Orb* is a hollow, 7-foot-diameter sphere of thin, polished mithral with a large skye (cloud) rune embossed on its outer surface. The orb levitates 10 feet above the ground and is keyed to a particular cloud castle, allowing you to control that castle's altitude and movement while the orb is inside the castle. If the orb is destroyed or removed from its castle, the castle's altitude and location remain fixed until the orb is returned or replaced.

As an action, you can cause one of the following effects to occur if you are touching the orb:

* The castle moves at a speed of 1 mph in a straight line, in a direction of your choice, until the castle stops or is made to stop, or until another action is used to change its direction. If this movement brings the castle into contact with the ground, the castle lands gently.
* The castle, if it is moving, comes to a gradual stop.
* The castle makes a slow, 90-degree turn clockwise or counterclockwise (turning a northerly view into a westerly view, for example). The castle can turn while it is moving in a straight line.

Any creature touching the orb knows the altitude of the base of the castle above the ground or water below it.

## Nimbus Coronet
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Bigby Presents - Glory of the Giants

*Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)*

The design of this bronze circlet resembles swirling clouds. At its center is set a deep-blue stone, upon which is inscribed the cloud rune.

While wearing this circlet, you take no damage from falling. Additionally, as a bonus action, you and everything you are wearing or carrying can teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 15 feet of yourself, reappearing in a puff of shimmering clouds.

**Invoking the Rune.** As an action, you can invoke the circlet’s rune to assume a cloudlike form. The form lasts for 1 minute, until you are incapacitated, or until you dismiss it (no action required).

While in cloud form, you have a flying speed of 60 feet and resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

Once the rune has been invoked, it can’t be invoked again until the next dawn.

## Nine Lives Stealer
Weapon (Attuned)
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)*

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

The sword has 1d8 + 1 charges. If you score a critical hit against a creature that has fewer than 100 hit points, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be slain instantly as the sword tears its life force from its body (a construct or an undead is immune). The sword loses 1 charge if the creature is slain. When the sword has no charges remaining, it loses this property.

## Nolzur's Marvelous Pigments
Wondrous Item
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, very rare*

Typically found in 1d4 pots inside a fine wooden box with a brush (weighing 1 pound in total), these pigments allow you to create three-dimensional objects by painting them in two dimensions. The paint flows from the brush to form the desired object as you concentrate on its image.

Each pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000 square feet of a surface, which lets you create inanimate objects or terrain features-such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weapons- that are up to 10,000 cubic feet. It takes 10 minutes to cover 100 square feet.

When you complete the painting, the object or terrain feature depicted becomes a real, nonmagical object. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door that can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit on a floor creates a real pit, and its depth counts against the total area of objects you create.

Nothing created by the pigments can have a value greater than 25 gp. If you paint an object of greater value (such as a diamond or a pile of gold), the object looks authentic, but close inspection reveals it is made from paste, bone, or some other worthless material.

If you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy appears but dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, doing no harm to anything.

## Oathbow
Weapon (Attuned)
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Weapon (longbow), very rare (requires attunement)*

When you nock an arrow on this bow, it whispers in Elvish, "Swift defeat to my enemies." When you use this weapon to make a ranged attack, you can, as a command phrase, say, "Swift death to you who have wronged me." The target of your attack becomes your sworn enemy until it dies or until dawn seven days later. You can have only one such sworn enemy at a time. When your sworn enemy dies, you can choose a new one after the next dawn.

When you make a ranged attack roll with this weapon against your sworn enemy, you have advantage on the roll. In addition, your target gains no benefit from cover, other than total cover, and you suffer no disadvantage due to long range. If the attack hits, your sworn enemy takes an extra 3d6 piercing damage.

While your sworn enemy lives, you have disadvantage on attack rolls with all other weapons.

## Oil of Sharpness
Potion
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Potion, very rare*

This clear, gelatinous oil sparkles with tiny, ultrathin silver shards. The oil can coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition. Applying the oil takes 1 minute. For 1 hour, the coated item is magical and has a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls.

## Orb of the Veil
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Explorer's Guide to Wildemount

*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*

This onyx sphere bears deep, spiraling grooves and dangles from an iron chain. While the orb is on your person, you gain the following benefits:

* Your Wisdom score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score.
* You gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, the orb increases its range by 60 feet.
* You have advantage on Wisdom checks to find hidden doors and paths.

***Curse.*** The orb is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the orb, keeping it on your person at all times. All nonmagical flames within 30 feet of you automatically extinguish, and fire damage dealt by you is halved.

*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*

You can use this contraption to fly, provided your weight (including whatever you are wearing or carrying) doesn't exceed 300 pounds. The ornithopter has a flying speed of 30 feet, and it moves according to your spoken directions while you are riding it. It can't hover. If the ornithopter loses its rider while airborne, it falls and can't fly again for 1d6 + 4 days.

The ornithopter is 8 feet long, has a 14-foot wingspan, and weighs 25 pounds.

Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Storm King's Thunder

*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*

This blue pennant is crafted from silk and is five feet long and whips about as if buffeted by a wind. The vind (wind) rune appears on its surface, looking almost like a cloud. The pennant has the following properties, which work only while it's on your person.

***Wind Step.*** As an action, you fly up to 20 feet. If you don't land at the end of this flight, you fall unless you have another means of staying aloft.

***Comforting Wind.*** You can't suffocate.

***Wind's Grasp.*** As a reaction when you fall, you can cause yourself to take no damage from the fall. Once you use this property, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

***Wind Walker.*** While you are attuned to this rune, you can cast [Levitate](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:levitate) as a bonus action. Once you use this property, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

***Gift of Wind.*** You can transfer the pennant's magic to a nonmagical item — a suit of armor, a pair of boots, or a cloak — by tracing the vind rune there with your finger. The transfer takes 8 hours of work that requires the two items to be within 5 feet of each other. At the end, the pennant is destroyed, and the rune appears in silver on the chosen item, which gains a benefit based on its form:

* **Armor.** The armor is now an uncommon magic item that requires attunement. You gain a bonus to speed of 5 feet while you wear the armor, and if it normally imposes disadvantage on Stealth checks, it no longer does so.
* **Boots/Cloak.** The pair of boots or cloak is now a rare magic item that requires attunement. While wearing the item, you can convert up to 20 feet of your movement on each of your turns into flight. If you don't land at the end of this flight, you fall unless you have another means of staying aloft. You can also cast [Feather Fall](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:feather-fall) once from the item, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a short or long rest.

When you attack a creature with this magic weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, the creature must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw in addition to suffering the attack’s normal effects. On a failed save, the creature also suffers the effects of a [Polymorph](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:polymorph) spell. Roll a d20 and consult the following table to determine the form the target creature is transformed into.

|d20|   New Form    |

|17 |    Octopus    |
|18 |      Cat      |
|19 |      Rat      |
|20 |    Rabbit     |

A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to damage of the weapon’s type, is a shapechanger, or has legendary actions.

***Curse.*** This weapon is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. Until the curse is broken with a [Remove Curse](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:remove-curse) spell or similar magic, you are unwilling to part with the weapon. Whenever you attack a creature with this weapon and roll a 1 on the attack roll, you suffer the effect of a [Polymorph](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:polymorph) spell for 1 hour, rolling on the table to determine your new form.

Wondrous Item
Source: Bigby Presents - Glory of the Giants

*Wondrous Item, Varies*

Larger and more roughly hewn than typical figurines of wondrous power, these statuettes depict dinosaurs and related creatures from the earliest days of the world.

As an action, you can throw a prehistoric figurine of wondrous power to a point on the ground within 60 feet of yourself while speaking a command word, whereupon the figurine magically transforms into a living creature. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn’t enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn’t become a creature.

The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions. See the *Monster Manual* for the creature’s statistics.

The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its statuette form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can’t be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine’s description.

**Carnelian Triceratops (Very Rare).** This figurine becomes a triceratops for up to 6 hours and can be ridden as a mount. Once it has been used, it can’t be used again until 10 days have passed.

**Jasper Tyrannosaurus Rex (Legendary).** This figurine, crafted from rare green jasper, becomes a tyrannosaurus rex for up to 1 hour. Once it has been used, it can’t be used again until 14 days have passed.

Whenever you command the figurine while it’s in tyrannosaurus rex form (including commanding it to revert to figurine form), you must roll a d20. On a 1, you lose control of the figurine, and it becomes hostile to you and your companions until it is reduced to 0 hit points, at which point it reverts to figurine form.

**Kyanite Pteranodon (Rare).** This figurine becomes a pteranodon for up to 8 hours. If your size is Medium or smaller, you can ride the pteranodon as a mount. Once it has been used, it can’t be used again until 7 days have passed.

**Pyrite Plesiosaurus (Uncommon).** This figurine becomes a plesiosaurus for up to 12 hours and can be ridden as a mount. Once it has been used, it can’t be used again until 4 days have passed.

While you are riding the plesiosaurus, you can use it to cast [Water Breathing](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:water-breathing) at will.

## Reincarnation Dust

Ring (Attuned)
Source: Bigby Presents - Glory of the Giants

*Ring, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)*

This ring is carved from hematite and bears an engraving of the friend rune.

When you first attune to this ring, you can touch one willing creature and form a magical bond between the two of you. While this bond lasts, whenever you are subjected to a spell or magical effect that restores hit points, the bonded creature also receives the benefits of the spell or effect.

You can bond with a different creature whenever you finish a long rest, provided that you can touch the creature and the creature is willing.

A creature can benefit from only one ring of amity’s bond at a time. The bond ends if either you or the creature travels to a different plane of existence, if you bond with a different creature at the end of a long rest, or if you sever the bond as a bonus action.

**Invoking the Rune.** When the bonded creature hits a target with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to invoke the ring’s rune if you are within 60 feet of the bonded creature. The bonded creature’s attack is then turned into a critical hit.

Once the rune has been invoked, it can’t be invoked again until the next dawn.

***Ruidium Corruption.*** When you use the Ruidium Rage property of the ring, you must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, you gain 1 level of exhaustion. If you are not already suffering from ruidium corruption, you become corrupted when you fail this save.

***If Ruidium Is Destroyed.*** If the Apotheon is killed or redeemed, all of the ruidium in Exandria is destroyed instantly, and the *Ring of Red Fury* becomes a [Ring of Free Action](/wondrous-items:ring-of-free-action).

Each sphere appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of you. The spheres last as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), up to 1 minute. Each sphere sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius.

As a bonus action, you can move each sphere up to 30 feet, but no farther than 120 feet away from you. When a creature other than you comes within 5 feet of a sphere, the sphere discharges lightning at that creature and disappears. That creature must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes lightning damage based on the number of spheres you created.

|Spheres|Lightning Damage|
|-------|----------------|
|   4   |      2d4       |
|   3   |      2d6       |

|   1   |      4d12      |

During this time, the robe sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Creatures that can see you have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. In addition, any creature in the bright light that can see you when the robe's power is activated must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become stunned until the effect ends.

Wondrous Item (Attuned)

## Rod of Absorption
Rod (Attuned)
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Rod, very rare (requires attunement)*

While holding this rod, you can use your reaction to absorb a spell that is targeting only you and not with an area of effect. The absorbed spell's effect is canceled, and the spell's energy - not the spell itself - is stored in the rod. The energy has the same level as the spell when it was cast. The rod can absorb and store up to 50 levels of energy over the course of its existence. Once the rod absorbs 50 levels of energy, it can't absorb more. If you are targeted by a spell that the rod can't store, the rod has no effect on that spell.

When you become attuned to the rod, you know how many levels of energy the rod has absorbed over the course of its existence, and how many levels of spell energy it currently has stored.

If you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you can convert energy stored in it into spell slots to cast spells you have prepared or know. You can create spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your own spell slots, up to a maximum of 5th level. You use the stored levels in place of your slots, but otherwise cast the spell as normal. For example, you can use 3 levels stored in the rod as a 3rd-level spell slot.

A newly found rod has 1d10 levels of spell energy stored in it already. A rod that can no longer absorb spell energy and has no energy remaining becomes nonmagical.

While in that bright light, you and any creature that is friendly to you gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws and can sense the location of any invisible hostile creature that is also in the bright light.

Regardless of its nature, the paradise contains enough water and food to sustain its visitors. Everything else that can be interacted with inside the extraplanar space can exist only there. For example, a flower picked from a garden in the paradise disappears if it is taken outside the extraplanar space.

For each hour spent in the paradise, a visitor regains hit points as if it had spent 1 Hit Die. Also, creatures don't age while in the paradise, although time passes normally. Visitors can remain in the paradise for up to 200 days divided by the number of creatures present (round down).

When the time runs out or you use an action to end it, all visitors reappear in the location they occupied when you activated the rod, or an unoccupied space nearest that location. The rod can't be used again until ten days have passed.

This can be any item that appears in chapter 5, "Equipment," of the *Player's Handbook*, or any similar item selected with the DM's permission. The summoned item is transported to you from somewhere else in the world, but it is generic in nature, so that you might call for a longsword but you cannot borrow a specific creature's longsword.

*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*

This shard of ice is long and slender, roughly the size of a dagger. The ise (ice) rune glows within it. The shard has the following properties, which work only while it's on your person.

***Frigid Touch.*** As an action, you can touch a body of water and freeze the water in a 10-foot-radius sphere around the spot you touched. Once you use this property, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

***Frost Friend.*** You have resistance to fire damage.

***Icy Mantle.*** As an action, you can touch yourself or another creature with water on your finger. The water creates an icy mantle of protection. The next time within the next minute that the target takes bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing damage, that damage is reduced to 0, and the mantle is destroyed. Once you use this property, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

***Winter's Howl.*** As an action, you can cast [Sleet Storm](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:sleet-storm) (spell save DC 17). You regain this ability after you finish a short or long rest.

***Gift of Frost.*** You can transfer the shard's magic to a nonmagical item — a cloak or a pair of boots — by tracing the ise rune there with your finger. The transfer takes 8 hours of work that requires the two items to be within 5 feet of each other. At the end, the shard is destroyed, and the rune appears in blue on the chosen item, which gains a benefit based on its form:

* **Cloak.** The cloak is now a rare magic item that requires attunement. While wearing it, you have resistance to fire damage, and you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made while in snowy terrain.
* **Boots.** The pair of boots is now a rare magic item that requires attunement. While wearing it, you ignore difficult terrain while walking, and you can walk on water.

Armor (Attuned)

*Armor (Shield), very rare (requires attunement)*

This shield is made from the scale of an ancient white dragon. It has a rune burned into its outward-facing side. A character who examines the rune and succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (History) check recognizes it as an uven ("enemy" in Giant) rune that confers great power.

While holding the shield, you benefit from the following properties.

**Winter's Friend.** You are immune to cold damage.

**Deadly Rebuke.** Immediately after a creature hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to deal 3d6 necrotic damage to that creature.

**Bane.** You can cast the *[Bane](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:bane)* spell from the shield (save DC 17). The spell does not require concentration and lasts for 1 minute. Once you cast the spell from the shield you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

**Gift of Vengeance.** You can transfer the shield's magic to a nonmagical weapon by tracing the uven rune on the weapon with one finger. The transfer takes 8 hours of work that requires the two items to be within 5 feet of each other. At the end, the shield is destroyed, and the rune is etched or burned into the chosen weapon. This weapon becomes a rare magic item that requires attunement. It has the properties of a +1 weapon. The bonus increases to +3 when the weapon is used against one of the following creature types, chosen by you at the time of the magic weapon's creation: aberrations, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants or undead.

Wondrous Item
Source: Eberron - Rising from the Last War

*Wondrous item, very rare*

The key to long-distance, virtually instantaneous communication across Khorvaire is House Sivis's network of message stations. Each station contains at least one *speaking stone*, which is carved from a Siberys dragonshard and inscribed with arcane symbols that uniquely identify it. If you're a gnome with the Mark of Scribing, you can touch the stone and use an action to cast the [Sending](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:sending) spell from it. The target is any other *speaking stone* whose location or unique sequence of symbols you know. A creature within 5 feet of the stone hears the message as if they were the target.

In a Sivis message station, a gnome is always on duty by the speaking stone, listening for messages that might come in and transcribing them for delivery to their intended recipients.

In addition, you have disadvantage on attack rolls made with weapons other than this one.

## Spell Gem
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Out of the Abyss

*Wondrous item, rarity varies (attunement optional)*

A *spell gem* can contain one spell from any class's spell list. You become aware of the spell when you learn the gems properties. While holding the gem. you can cast the spell from it as an action if you know the spell or if the spell is on your class spell list. Doing so doesn‘t require any components and doesn't require attunement. The spell then disappears from the gem.

If the spell is of a higher level than you can normally cast. you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a failed check. the spell disappears from the gem with no other effect.

Each *spell gem* has a maximum level for the spell it can store. The spell level determines the gems rarity and the stored spell's saving throw DC and attack bonus. as shown in the Spell Gem table.

You can imbue the gem with a spell if you're attuned to it and it's empty. To do so, you cast the spell while holding the gem. The spell is stored in the gem instead of having any effect. Casting the spell must require either 1 action or 1 minute or longer, and the spell's level must be no higher than the gem's maximum. If the spell belongs to the school of abjuration and requires material components that are consumed. you must provide them. but they can be worth half as much as normal.

Once imbued with a spell. the gem can't be imbued again until the next dawn.

Deep gnomes created these magic gemstones and keep the creation process a secret.

## Spell Scroll
Scroll
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Scroll, rarity varies*

A *spell scroll* bears the words of a single spell, written in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class’s spell list, you can read the scroll and cast its spell without providing any material components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible. Casting the spell by reading the scroll requires the spell’s normal casting time. Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and it crumbles to dust. If the casting is interrupted, the scroll is not lost.

If the spell is on your class's spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect.

Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and the scroll itself crumbles to dust.

The level of the spell on the scroll determines the spell's saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as the scroll's rarity, as shown in the Spell Scroll table.

A wizard spell on a *spell scroll* can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When a spell is copied from a *spell scroll*, the copier must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level.

## Wyrmreaver Gauntlets
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Bigby Presents - Glory of the Giants

*Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)*

Originally crafted for ground-bound giant brawlers to fight against dragons and other enormous predators of the sky, these studded gauntlets are engraved with the dragon rune.

While you are wearing these gauntlets, your unarmed strike deals an additional 1d6 force damage on a hit. Additionally, whenever you finish a long rest, choose one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. You have resistance to the chosen damage type until you finish another long rest.

**Invoking the Runes.** As a bonus action, you can invoke the gauntlets’ runes and summon two enormous spectral fists that envelop the gauntlets and mimic your hand motions. The fists can also launch themselves to strike distant opponents, returning immediately to your space after they hit or miss.

The fists last for 1 minute or until you are incapacitated. While the spectral fists are active, unarmed strikes you make on your turn have a reach of 30 feet, and when you hit a creature with an opportunity attack made with your unarmed strike, the creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or have the prone condition.

Once the runes have been invoked, they can’t be invoked again until the next dawn.
