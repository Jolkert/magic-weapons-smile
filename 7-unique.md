## Draakhorn
Wondrous Item
Source: The Rise of Tiamat

*Wondrous item, unique*

The *Draakhorn* was a gift from Tiamat in the war between dragons and giants. It was once the horn of her ancient red dragon consort, Ephelomon, that she gave to dragonkind to help them in their war against the giants. The *Draakhorn* is a signaling device, and it is so large that it requires two Medium creatures (or one Large or larger) to hold it while a third creature sounds it, making the earth resonate to its call. The horn has been blasted with fire into a dark ebony hue and is wrapped in bands of bronze with draconic runes that glow with purple eldritch fire.

The low, moaning drone of the *Draakhorn* discomfits normal animals within a few miles, and it alerts all dragons within two thousand miles to rise and be wary, for great danger is at hand. Coded blasts were once used to signal specific messages. Knowledge of those codes has been lost to the ages.

Those with knowledge of the *Draakhorn’s* history know that it was first built to signal danger to chromatic dragons —- a purpose the Cult of the Dragon has corrupted to call chromatic dragons to the Well of Dragons from across the North.

While the horn is sounding, a creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw the first time on a turn the creature enters a 150-foot cone in front of the horn or starts its turn there. On a failed save, the creature takes 27 (6d8) thunder damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and isn’t knocked prone. The horn can’t be turned or aimed at a specific target.

## Gnomengarde Grenade
Wondrous Item
*Wondrous item, unique*

This small metallic object is comprised of rune-covered parts made from different metals, linked together with a variety of gears, bands, bits, and bobs. The metals are all different colors, making the grenade shine with a rainbow of color when held up in the light.

As a bonus action, a creature can turn a special key to arm the grenade. Once armed, the grenade explodes in a matter of seconds. As an action, the wielder can hurl the grenade up to 120 feet. At the end of their turn, the grenade explodes. All creatures within 60 feet of the grenade when it explodes suffer the following effects:

* Each creature must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much fire damage on a successful one.

* Each creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 28 (8d6) thunder damage and is stunned until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much thunder damage and is not stunned.

* The wielder rolls on the chart for the [Wand of Wonder](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:wand-of-wonder) three times, rerolling any duplicate results. Any effects that specify a target affect all creatures in range of the grenade when it explodes. Any effects that would affect the wielder of the wand instead affect the closest creature to the grenade when it goes off.

The grenade explodes immediately if a creature places it in an extradimensional space or teleports while in possession of it. The effects of the explosion will be felt at both the origin and terminus of the teleportation, but only affecting all creatures within 30 feet of either location.

## Mask of the Dragon Queen
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Tyranny of Dragons

*Wondrous item, unique (requires attunement)*

Individually, the five [Dragon Masks](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:dragon-mask) resemble the dragons they are named for. When two or more of the dragon masks are assembled, however, they transform magically into the *Mask of the Dragon Queen*. Each mask shrinks to become the modeled head of a chromatic dragon, appearing to roar its devotion to Tiamat where all the masks brought together are arranged crown-like on the wearer's head. Below the five masks, a new mask shapes itself, granting the wearer a draconic visage that covers the face, neck, and shoulders.

While you are attuned to and wear this mask, you can have any of the properties from any one mask. Additionally, you gain the Damage Absorption from each of the five [Dragon Masks](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:dragon-mask), and you gain five uses of the Legendary Resistance property.
