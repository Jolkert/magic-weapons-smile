See the *Monster Manual* for the creature's statistics. The creature vanishes at the next dawn or when it is reduced to 0 hit points.

The creature is friendly to you and your companions, and it acts on your turn.

In the absence of such orders, the creature acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature.

Once three fuzzy objects have been pulled from the bag, the bag can't be used again until the next dawn.

Doing so requires you to place the scale on a solid surface, then sprinkle the pans with holy water or place a transparent gem worth 100 gp in each pan. The scale remains motionless if it detects nothing, tips to one side or the other for good (consecrated) or evil (desecrated), and fluctuates slightly if it detects a creature appropriate to the spell but neither good nor evil.

This stoppered flask sloshes when shaken, as if it contains water. The decanter weighs 2 pounds.

You can use an action to remove the stopper and speak one of three command words, whereupon an amount of fresh water or salt water (your choice) pours out of the flask. The water stops pouring out at the start of your next turn. Choose from the following options:

* "Stream" produces 1 gallon of water.

* "Fountain" produces 5 gallons of water.

* "Geyser" produces 30 gallons of water that gushes forth in a geyser 30 feet long and 1 foot wide. As a bonus action while holding the decanter, you can aim the geyser at a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage and fall prone. Instead of a creature, you can target an object that isn't being worn or carried and that weighs no more than 200 pounds. The object is either knocked over or pushed up to 15 feet away from you.

## Deck of Illusions
Wondrous Item
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, uncommon*

This box contains a set of parchment cards. A full deck has 34 cards. A deck found as treasure is usually missing 1d20 - 1 cards.

The magic of the deck functions only if cards are drawn at random (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). You can use an action to draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the ground at a point within 30 feet of you.

An illusion of one or more creatures forms over the thrown card and remains until dispelled. An illusory creature appears real, of the appropriate size, and behaves as if it were a real creature (as presented in the *Monster Manual*), except that it can do no harm. While you are within 120 feet of the illusory creature and can see it, you can use an action to move it magically anywhere within 30 feet of its card. Any physical interaction with the illusory creature reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it. Someone who uses an action to visually inspect the creature identifies it as illusory with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The creature then appears translucent.

The illusion lasts until its card is moved or the illusion is dispelled. When the illusion ends, the image on its card disappears, and that card can't be used again.

## Deck Of Miscellany
Wondrous Item
Source: The Book of Many Things

*Wondrous Item, uncommon*

This wooden box contains a set of thirty-two parchment cards.

The face of each card bears an illustration of a different item or set of items. As an action, you can draw a card of your choice from the deck and throw it to the ground in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of yourself. When the card hits the ground, the card permanently transforms into the item or set of items depicted on its face. An altered deck of real-world playing cards can simulate the deck, as shown on the Deck of Miscellany table.

## Deck Of Wonder
Wondrous Item
Source: The Book of Many Things

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

Created in the image of the Deck of Many Things, this deck of ivory or vellum cards bestows an assortment of minor benefits and penalties on those who draw from it. Most (75 percent) of these decks have only thirteen cards, but the rest have twenty-two.

Before you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw, then draw them randomly. Any additional cards drawn have no effect. Unless a card states otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card you declared no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck and take effect simultaneously.

Unless it is the Mystery card, a drawn card immediately takes effect, fades from existence, and reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card multiple times.

You can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck, as shown in the Deck of Wonder table.

\*Found only in a deck with twenty-two cards.

**Beginning.** Your hit point maximum and current hit points increase by 2d10. Your hit point maximum remains increased in this way for the next 8 hours.

**Champion.** You gain a +1 bonus to weapon attack and damage rolls. This bonus lasts for 8 hours.

**Chancellor\*.** Within 8 hours of drawing this card, you can cast [Augury](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:augury) once as an action, requiring no material components. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice).

**Chaos**. You gain resistance to one of the following damage types (chosen by the DM): acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. This resistance lasts for 1d12 days.

**Coin\*.** Five pieces of jewelry, each worth 100 gp, or ten gemstones, each worth 50 gp, appear at your feet.

**Crown.** You learn the [Friends](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:friends) cantrip. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice). If you already know this cantrip, the card has no effect.

**Dawn.** This card invigorates you. For the next 8 hours, you can add your proficiency bonus to your initiative rolls.

**Day.** You gain a +1 bonus to saving throws. This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest.

**Destiny\*.** This card protects you against an untimely demise. The first time after drawing this card that you would drop to 0 hit points from taking damage, you instead drop to 1 hit point.

**Dusk\*.** This card supernaturally saps your energy. You have disadvantage on initiative rolls. This effect lasts until you finish a long rest, but it can be ended early by a [Remove Curse](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:remove-curse) spell or similar magic.

**End.** This card is an omen of death. You take 2d10 necrotic damage, and your hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This effect can’t reduce your hit point maximum below 10 hit points. This reduction lasts until you finish a long rest, but it can be ended early by a [Remove Curse](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:remove-curse) spell or similar magic.

**Isolation\*.** You disappear, along with anything you are wearing or carrying, and become trapped in a harmless extradimensional space for 1d4 minutes. You draw no more cards. You then reappear in the space you left or the nearest unoccupied space. When you reappear, you must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or have the poisoned condition for 1 hour as your body reels from the extradimensional travel.

**Justice\*.** You momentarily gain the ability to balance the scales of fate. For the next 8 hours, whenever you or a creature within 60 feet of you is about to roll a d20 with advantage or disadvantage, you can use your reaction to prevent the roll from being affected by advantage or disadvantage.

**Knife.** An uncommon magic weapon you’re proficient with appears in your hands. The DM chooses the weapon.

**Lock.** You gain the ability to cast [Knock](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:knock) 1d3 times. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice).

**Mischief.** You receive an uncommon wondrous item (chosen by the DM), or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.

**Monster.** This card’s monstrous visage curses you. While cursed in this way, whenever you make a saving throw, you must roll 1d4 and subtract the number rolled from the total. The curse lasts until you finish a long rest, but it can be ended early with a [Remove Curse](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:remove-curse) spell or similar magic.

**Mystery\*.** You have disadvantage on Intelligence saving throws for 1 hour. Discard this card and draw from the deck again; together, the two draws count as one of your declared draws.

**Night.** You gain darkvision within a range of 300 feet. This darkvision lasts for 8 hours.

**Order.** You gain resistance to one of the following damage types (chosen by the DM): force, necrotic, poison, psychic, or radiant. This resistance lasts for 1d12 days.

**Student\*.** You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain proficiency in Intelligence or Charisma saving throws (your choice).

**Vulture\*.** One nonmagical item or piece of equipment in your possession (chosen by the DM) disappears. The item remains nearby but concealed for a short time, so it can be found with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. If the item isn’t recovered within 1 hour, it disappears forever.

## Dragon's Wrath Weapon
Weapon (Attuned)
Source: Fizban's Treasury of Dragons

*Weapon (Any), Rarity Varies (Requires Attunement)*

This weapon is decorated with dragon heads, claws, wings, scales, or Draconic letters. When it steeps in a dragon’s hoard, it absorbs the energy of the dragon’s breath weapon and deals damage of that type with its special properties.

As an action, you can unleash a 30-foot cone of destructive energy from the weapon. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 8d6 damage of the type dealt by the dragon’s breath weapon on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once this action is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

**Ascendant (Legendary).** The Ascendant weapon has the Slumbering property, and it improves on the Stirring and Wakened properties. The bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +3, and the extra damage dealt by the weapon increases to 3d6.

Source: Fizban's Treasury of Dragons

*Wondrous Item, Rarity Varies (Requires Attunement by a Spellcaster)*

**Slumbering (Uncommon).** You have advantage on initiative rolls. While you are holding the focus, it can function as a spellcasting focus for all your spells.

**Stirring (Rare).** The Stirring focus has the Slumbering property, and it gains an additional property determined by the family of the dragon in whose hoard it became Stirring:

Chromatic. Whenever you use a spell slot to cast a spell that deals acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison damage, roll a d6, and you gain a bonus equal to the number rolled to one of the spell’s damage rolls.

Gem. Whenever you use a spell slot to cast a spell, you can immediately teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 15 feet of you.

Metallic. When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes a saving throw, you can use your reaction to give that creature advantage on the saving throw.

**Wakened (Very Rare).** The Wakened focus has the Slumbering and Stirring properties, and while you are holding a Wakened focus, you can use it to cast certain spells. Once the item is used to cast a given spell, it can’t be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells are determined by the family of the dragon in whose hoard it became Wakened.

Chromatic. [Hold Monster](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:hold-monster), [Rime’s Binding Ice](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:rimes-binding-ice)

Gem. [Rary’s Telepathic Bond](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:rarys-telepathic-bond), [Raulothim’s Psychic Lance](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:raulothims-psychic-lance)

Once this property is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

## Dried Leech
Weapon
Source: The Book of Many Things

*Weapon (any ammunition), uncommon*

This leech has been dried and imbued with a mote of animating magic. If you hit a creature with a ranged attack roll using this ammunition, the leech springs to life and sinks its teeth into the target, dealing 1d4 piercing damage at the start of each of the target’s turns. If the leech deals at least 10 damage or the target dies, the leech falls off. A creature, including the target, can use its action to detach the leech. Once a leech is no longer attached to its target, the leech dies and is no longer magical.

## Driftglobe
Wondrous Item
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, uncommon*

This small sphere of thick glass weighs 1 pound. If you are within 60 feet of it, you can speak its command word and cause it to emanate the [Light](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:light) or [Daylight](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:daylight) spell. Once used, the Daylight effect can't be used again until the next dawn.

You can speak another command word as an action to make the illuminated globe rise into the air and float no more than 5 feet off the ground. The globe hovers in this way until you or another creature grasps it. If you move more than 60 feet from the hovering globe, it follows you until it is within 60 feet of you. It takes the shortest route to do so. If prevented from moving, the globe sinks gently to the ground and becomes inactive, and its light winks out.

## Dust of Corrosion
Wondrous Item
Source: The Wild Beyond The Witchlight

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

As an action, you can throw this dust into the air, filling a 10-foot cube that extends out from you. Surfaces and objects made of nonmagical ferrous metal in the area instantly corrode and turn to dust, becoming useless and unsalvageable. Any creature in the area that is made wholly or partly out of ferrous metal must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 4d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Found in a small packet, this dust is made from finely ground rust monster antennae. There is enough dust in each packet for one use.

## Dust of Deliciousness
Wondrous Item
Source: Explorer's Guide to Wildemount

*Wondrous item, uncommon*

This reddish brown dust can be sprinkled over any edible substance to greatly improve the flavor. The dust also dulls the eater's senses: anyone eating food treated with this dust has disadvantage on Wisdom ability checks and Wisdom saving throws for 1 hour. There is enough dust to flavor six servings.

## Dust of Disappearance
Wondrous Item
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, uncommon*

Found in a small packet, this powder resembles very fine sand. There is enough of it for one use. When you use an action to throw the dust into the air, you and each creature and object within 10 feet of you become invisible for 2d4 minutes. The duration is the same for all subjects, and the dust is consumed when its magic takes effect. If a creature affected by the dust attacks or casts a spell, the invisibility ends for that creature.

## Dust of Dryness
Wondrous Item
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, uncommon*

This small packet contains 1d6 + 4 pinches of dust. You can use an action to sprinkle a pinch of it over water. The dust turns a cube of water 15 feet on a side into one marble-sized pellet, which floats or rests near where the dust was sprinkled. The pellet's weight is negligible.

Someone can use an action to smash the pellet against a hard surface, causing the pellet to shatter and release the water the dust absorbed. Doing so ends that pellet's magic.

An elemental composed mostly of water that is exposed to a pinch of the dust must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Dust of Sneezing and Choking
Wondrous Item
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, uncommon*

Found in a small container, this powder resembles very fine sand. It appears to be [Dust of Disappearance](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:dust-of-disappearance), and an [Identify](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:identify) spell reveals it to be such. There is enough of it for one use.

When you use an action to throw a handful of the dust into the air, you and each creature that needs to breathe within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become unable to breathe, while sneezing uncontrollably. A creature affected in this way is incapacitated and suffocating. As long as it is conscious, a creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on it on a success. The [Lesser Restoration](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:lesser-restoration) spell can also end the effect on a creature.

## Earworm
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Eberron - Rising from the Last War

*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

To attune to this symbiont, you must hold it against the skin behind your ear for the entire attunement period, whereupon it burrows into your head and bonds to your skull. While the *earworm* is inside you, you can speak, read, and write Deep Speech.

***Spells.*** The *earworm* has 4 charges. You can cast the following spells from it, expending the necessary number of charges (spell save DC 15): [Detect Thoughts](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:detect-thoughts) (2 charges) or [Dissonant Whispers](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:dissonant-whispers) (1 charge). Each time you use the *earworm* to cast the [Detect Thought](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:detect-thoughts) spell, it sends the information gleaned to the nearest daelkyr, or to the next nearest *earworm* until it reaches a daelkyr.

The *earworm* regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn.

***Symbiotic Nature.*** The *earworm* can't be removed from you while you're attuned to it, and you can't voluntarily end your attunement to it. If you're targeted by a spell that ends a curse, your attunement to the earworm ends, and it exits your body.

## Eldritch Claw Tattoo
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything

*Wondrous item (tattoo), uncommon (requires attunement)*

Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo depicts clawlike forms and other jagged shapes.

**Tattoo Attunement.** To attune to this item, you hold the needle to your skin where you want the tattoo to appear, pressing the needle there throughout the attunement process. When the attunement is complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the skin.

If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo vanishes, and the needle reappears in your space.

**Magical Strikes.** While the tattoo is on your skin, your unarmed strikes are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming immunity and resistance to nonmagical attacks, and you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with unarmed strikes.

**Eldritch Maul.** As a bonus action, you can empower the tattoo for 1 minute. For the duration, each of your melee attacks with a weapon or an unarmed strike can reach a target up to 15 feet away from you, as inky tendrils launch toward the target. In addition, your melee attacks deal an extra 1d6 force damage on a hit. Once used, this bonus action can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Elemental Gem
Wondrous Item
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, uncommon*

This gem contains a mote of elemental energy. When you use an action to break the gem, an elemental is summoned as if you had cast the [Conjure Elemental](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:conjure-elemental) spell, and the gem's magic is lost. The type of gem determines the elemental summoned by the spell.

|     Gem      |Summoned Elemental|
|--------------|------------------|
|Blue sapphire |  Air elemental   |
|Yellow diamond| Earth elemental  |
| Red corundum |  Fire elemental  |
|   Emerald    | Water elemental  |

## Emerald Pen
Wondrous Item
Source: Fizban's Treasury of Dragons

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

This pen is tipped with an emerald nib and requires no ink to write. While holding this pen, you can cast [Illusory Script](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:illusory-script) at will, requiring no material components.

## Eversmoking Bottle
Wondrous Item
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, uncommon*

Smoke leaks from the lead-stoppered mouth of this brass bottle, which weighs 1 pound. When you use an action to remove the stopper, a cloud of thick smoke pours out in a 60-foot radius from the bottle. The cloud's area is heavily obscured. Each minute the bottle remains open and within the cloud, the radius increases by 10 feet until it reaches its maximum radius of 120 feet.

The cloud persists as long as the bottle is open. Closing the bottle requires you to speak its command word as an action. Once the bottle is closed, the cloud disperses after 10 minutes. A moderate wind (11 to 20 miles per hour) can also disperse the smoke after 1 minute, and a strong wind (21 or more miles per hour) can do so after 1 round.

## Eyes of Charming
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. They have 3 charges. While wearing them, you can expend 1 charge as an action to cast the [Charm Person](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:charm-person) spell (save DC 13) on a humanoid within 30 feet of you, provided that you and the target can see each other. The lenses regain all expended charges daily at dawn.

## Eyes of Minute Seeing
Wondrous Item
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, uncommon*

These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wearing them, you can see much better than normal out to a range of 1 foot. You have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks that rely on sight while searching an area or studying an object within that range.

## Eyes of the Eagle
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wearing them, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. In conditions of clear visibility, you can make out details of even extremely distant creatures and objects as small as 2 feet across.

## Fabulist Gem
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: The Book of Many Things

*Wonderous Item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

This glittering red gem is commonly found embedded in a ring or brooch.

While wearing the gem, you gain the following benefits.

**Counterfeit Coins.** You can use your action to magically create a pile of coins, worth no more than 100 gp total, in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of yourself. The pile must appear on a surface that can support it. After 1 hour, the coins vanish, regardless of where they are. Once this action is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

**Illusory Fashion.** As a bonus action, you can magically change the appearance of your clothing and armor. You can change the style, color, and apparent quality of what you’re wearing, or you can make it appear as if you were wearing different garments entirely. In either case, the changes wrought by this magic fail to pass physical inspection.

## Feywild Shard
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything

*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a sorcerer)*

This warm crystal glints with the sunset colors of the Feywild sky and evokes whispers of emotional memory. As an action, you can attach the shard to a Tiny object (such as a weapon or a piece of jewelry) or detach it. It falls off if your attunement to it ends. You can use the shard as a spellcasting focus while you hold or wear it.

When you use a Metamagic option on a spell while you are holding or wearing the shard, you can roll on the Wild Magic Surge table in the *Player's Handbook*. If the result is a spell, it is too wild to be affected by your Metamagic, and if it normally requires concentration, it doesn't require concentration in this case; the spell lasts for its full duration.

If you don't have the Wild Magic Sorcerous Origin, once this property is used to roll on the Wild Magic Surge table, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Figurine of Wondrous Power
Wondrous Item
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide, Fizban's Treasury of Dragons

*Wondrous item, rarity by figurine*

A *Figurine of Wondrous Power* is a statuette of a beast small enough to fit in a pocket. If you use an action to speak the command word and throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the figurine becomes a living creature. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn't become a creature.

The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions. See the *Monster Manuel* for the creature's statistics.

The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine's description.

***Bronze Griffon (Rare).*** This bronze statuette is of a griffon rampant. It can become a **griffon** for up to 6 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 5 days have passed.

***Ebony Fly (Rare).*** This ebony statuette is carved in the likeness of a horsefly. It can become a **giant fly** for up to 12 hours and can be ridden as a mount. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed.

***Golden Lions (Rare).*** These gold statuettes of lions are always created in pairs. You can use one figurine or both simultaneously. Each can become a **lion** for up to 1 hour. Once a lion has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

***Ivory Goats (Rare).*** These ivory statuettes of goats are always created in sets of three. Each goat looks unique and functions differently from the others. Their properties are as follows

* The *goat of traveling* can become a **Large goat** with the same statistics as a **riding horse**. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in beast form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can't be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all its charges.

* The *goat of travail* becomes a **giant goat** for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 30 days have passed.

* The *goat of terror* becomes a **giant goat** for up to 3 hours. The goat can't attack, but you can remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes a *+1 lance*, and the other becomes a *+2 longsword*. Removing a horn requires an action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form. In addition, the goat radiates a 30-foot-radius aura of terror while you are riding it. Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the goat for 1 minute, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it successfully saves against the effect, a creature is immune to the goat's aura for the net 24 hours. Once the figurine has been used, it can't be used again until 15 days have passed.

***Marble Elephant (Rare).*** This marble statuette is about 4 inches high and long. It can become an **elephant** for up to 24 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

***Obsidian Steed (Very Rare).*** This polished obsidian horse can become a **nightmare** for up to 24 hours. The nightmare fights only to defend itself. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 5 days have passed.

If you have a good alignment, the figurine has a 10 percent chance each time you use it to ignore your orders, including a command to revert to figurine form. If you mount the nightmare while it is ignoring your orders, you and the nightmare are instantly transported to a random location on the plane of Hades, where the nightmare reverts to figurine form.

***Onyx Dog (Rare).*** This onyx statuette of a dog can become a **mastiff** for up to 6 hours. The mastiff has an Intelligence of 8 and can speak Common. It also has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet and can see invisible creatures and objects within that range. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

***Serpentine Owl (Rare).*** This serpentine statuette of an owl can become a **giant owl** for up to 8 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed. The owl can telepathically communicate with you at any range if you and it are on the same plane of existence.

***Silver Raven (Uncommon).*** This silver statuette of a raven can become a **raven** for up to 12 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed. While in raven form, the figurine allows you to cast the [Animal Messenger](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:animal-messenger) spell on it at will.

In addition, the following *Figurine of Wondrous Power* was added in *Fizban's Treasury of Dragons:*

***Gold Canary (Legendary)***  
*Giant Canary Form.* The figurine becomes a giant canary (see the accompanying stat block) for up to 8 hours and can be ridden as a mount. Once the figurine has become a giant canary, it can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.  
*Gold Dragon Form.* While you are missing half or more of your hit points, you can speak a different command word and the figurine becomes an adult gold dragon for up to 1 hour. The dragon can’t use any legendary actions or lair actions. Once the figurine has become an adult gold dragon, it can’t be used this way again until 1 year has passed.

Wondrous Item
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, uncommon*

This prism has 50 charges. While you are holding it, you can use an action to speak one of three command words to cause one of the following effects:

* The first command word causes the gem to shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This effect doesn't expend a charge. It lasts until you use a bonus action to repeat the command word or until you use another function of the gem.

* The second command word expends 1 charge and causes the gem to fire a brilliant beam of light at one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

* The third command word expends 5 charges and causes the gem to flare with blinding light in a 30-foot cone originating from it. Each creature in the cone must make a saving throw as if struck by the beam created with the second command word.

When all of the gem's charges are expended, the gem becomes a non magical jewel worth 50 gp.

## Guild Keyrune
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica

*Wondrous item, rarity by keyrune (requires attunement by a member of the relevant guild)*

Associated with a particular guild, a *guild keyrune* is a ceremonial, stylized key, about 1 foot long, made from carved stone. Not a literal key, the item is a badge of authority that gives its bearer access to privileged places in its guild's headquarters and outposts. At the DM's discretion, a character might be given a keyrune upon attaining a renown score of 25 in their guild.

When you use an action to speak the item's command word and place the keyrune on the ground in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, the keyrune transforms into a creature. If there isn't enough space for the creature, the keyrune doesn't transform. See the *Monster Manual* for the creature's stat block — the name of which is given in bold in the keyrune's description — unless you're directed to chapter 6 of this book instead.

The creature is friendly to you, your companions, and other members of your guild (unless those guild members are hostile to you). It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature takes the Dodge action and moves to avoid danger.

The creature exists for a duration specific to each keyrune. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its keyrune form. It reverts early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature reverts to its keyrune form, it can't transform again until 36 hours have passed.

***Azorius Keyrune (Rare).*** This keyrune is carved from white marble and lapis lazuli to resemble a noble bird of prey. It can become a **giant eagle** for up to 1 hour. While the transformed eagle is within l mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. As an action, you can see through the eagle's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, and you gain the benefit of its keen sight. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.

***Boros Keyrune (Rare).*** Carved from red sandstone with white granite elements to resemble a member of the Boros Legion, this keyrune can become a **veteran** (human) for up to 8 hours. In addition to fighting on your behalf, this veteran cheerfully offers tactical advice, which is usually sound. Anyone who talks with the transformed keyrune or examines it closely can easily recognize that it is an artificial human.

***Dimir Keyrune (Very Rare).*** This keyrune, carved from black stone accented with steel, resembles a stylized horror. On command, it transforms into an **intellect devourer** that resembles the Dimir guild symbol, with six bladelike legs. The creature exists for up to 24 hours. During that time, it pursues only a single mission you give it — usually an assignment to take over someone's body, either to impersonate that person for a brief time or to extract secrets from their mind. When the mission is complete, the creature returns to you, reports its success, and reverts to its keyrune form.

***Golgari Keyrune (Very Rare).*** Made from deep green jade with black veins, this keyrune has an insectile shape. It can transform into a **giant scorpion** for up to 6 hours. The scorpion has an Intelligence of 4 and can communicate with you telepathically while it is within 60 feet of you, though its messages are largely limited to describing the passage of potential prey.

***Gruul Keyrune (Rare).*** This crude keyrune is cobbled together from bits of rubble, broken glass, bone, and animal hair. One end resembles a horned beast. On command, the keyrune transforms into a ceratok, a horned creature much like a **rhinoceros** (and with the same statistics). It remains in its ceratok form for 1 hour.

***Izzet Keyrune (Rare).*** Formed of carved and polished red and blue stone, the keyrune includes bits of cable and wire. One end resembles a humanlike head, suggesting the jagged elemental form of the **galvanice weird** (see chapter 6 for the stat block) that it can become for a duration of 3 hours. In this form, it will serve you as a bodyguard, lift and carry things for you, act as a test subject for your experiments, or aid you in any other way that its capabilities allow.

***Orzhov Keyrune (Rare).*** This keyrune is carved from white marble with veins of black. The end is shaped like a thrull's head, with a gold faceplate affixed. On command, the keyrune transforms into a **winged thrull** (see chapter 6 for the stat block) for up to 2 hours. If you don't come from an Orzhov oligarch family, it serves you grudgingly, clownishly aping your movements and mannerisms while carrying out your orders.

***Rakdos Keyrune (Uncommon).*** This dark granite keyrune is marbled with scarlet veins and carved with the leering visage of a mischievous demon. When activated, it transforms into a **cackler** (see chapter 6 for the stat block) for up to 1 hour.

***Selesnya Keyrune (Rare).*** Carved from white and green marble in the shape of a wolf's head, this keyrune transforms into a **dire wolf**. The wolf persists for 8 hours. Its Intelligence is 6, and it understands Elvish and Sylvan but can't speak those languages. While it is within 1 mile of you. you can communicate with each other telepathically.

***Simic Keyrune (Uncommon).*** This keyrune is assembled from coral, mother-of pearl, and chrome and adorned with the spirals and curves characteristic of Simic ornamentation. The head resembles the shell of a sea creature. On command, the keyrune turns into a **category 1 krasis** (see chapter 6 for the stat block) that has the Grabber and Stabilizing Legs adaptations. The transformation lasts for up to 5 hours.

## Guild Signet
Ring (Attuned)
Source: Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica

*Ring, uncommon (requires attunement)*

This ring, adorned with the symbol of a guild, allows you to cast one spell closely associated with that guild, as shown in the Guild Signet Spells table. A guild signet is sometimes awarded to a guild member whose renown score in that guild is 5 or higher, as a reward for performing special services for the guild. Aside from its magical properties, the ring is also an indicator of the guild's recognition and favor.

A signet has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing it, you can expend 1 charge to cast the associated spell (save DC 13).

Upon donning or removing the necklace, whether you are attuned to it or not, you are afflicted with werewolf lycanthropy as detailed in the *Monster Manual*.

## Immovable Rod
Rod

*Rod, uncommon*

This flat iron rod has a button on one end. You can use an action to press the button, which causes the rod to become magically fixed in place. Until you or another creature uses an action to push the button again, the rod doesn't move, even if it is defying gravity. The rod can hold up to 8,000 pounds of weight. More weight causes the rod to deactivate and fall. A creature can use an action to make a DC 30 Strength check, moving the fixed rod up to 10 feet on a success.

## Infernal Puzzle Box
Wondrous Item
Source: Baldur's Gate - Descent into Avernus

*Wondrous item, uncommon*

An *infernal puzzle box* is a cube-shaped container 5 to 6 inches on a side, composed of airtight, interlocking parts made from materials found in the Nine Hells. Most of these boxes are made of infernal iron, though some are carved from bone or horn. *Infernal puzzle boxes* are used to safeguard diabolical contracts signed between devils and mortals, even after the terms of these contracts are fulfilled. An empty *infernal puzzle box* weighs 3 pounds regardless of the materials used to fashion it.

When an object small enough to fit inside an *infernal puzzle box* is placed in it, the container magically seals shut around the object, and no magic can force the box open. The sealed box becomes immune to all damage as well. Every *infernal puzzle box* is constructed with a unique means of opening it. The trick to solving the puzzle is always mundane, never magical. Once a creature figures out the trick or sequence of steps needed to open a particular *infernal puzzle box*, that creature can open the box as an action, allowing access to the box's contents.

A creature that spends 1 hour holding an *infernal puzzle box* while trying to open it can make a DC 30 Intelligence (Investigation) check. If the check succeeds, the creature figures out the trick or sequence of steps needed to open the box. If the check fails by 5 or more, the creature must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

* When you examine an object, you can make a Wisdom (Perception) check to identify the aura of the last living creature to touch the object. The DC is 13 + the number of days since the last contact occurred. If the check is successful, you learn the species of the creature and you can immediately use your Imprint Prey ability to target this creature.

## Insignia of Claws
Wondrous Item
Source: Tyranny of Dragons

*Wondrous item, uncommon*

The jewels in this insignia of the Cult of the Dragon flare with purple light when you enter combat, empowering your natural fists or natural weapons.

While wearing the insignia, you gain a +1 bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls you make with unarmed strikes and natural weapons. Such attacks are considered to be magical.

## Instrument of the Bards
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement by a bard)*

An *instrument of the bards* is an exquisite example of its kind, superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a legendary bard college. The following table lists the spells common to all instruments, as well as the spells specific to each one and its rarity. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 2d4 psychic damage.

You can use an action to play the instrument and cast one of its spells. Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.

You can play the instrument while casting a spell that causes any of its targets to be charmed on a failed saving throw, thereby imposing disadvantage on the save. This effect applies only if the spell has a somatic or a material component.

## Javelin of Lightning
Weapon
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Weapon (javelin), uncommon*

This javelin is a magic weapon. When you hurl it and speak its command word, it transforms into a bolt of lightning, forming a line 5 feet wide that extends out from you to a target within 120 feet. Each creature in the line excluding you and the target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 lightning damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The lightning bolt turns back into a javelin when it reaches the target. Make a ranged weapon attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes damage from the javelin plus 4d6 lightning damage.

The javelin's property can't be used again until the next dawn. In the meantime, the javelin can still be used as a magic weapon.

## Keoghtom's Ointment
Wondrous Item
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, uncommon*

This glass jar, 3 inches in diameter, contains 1d4 + 1 doses of a thick mixture that smells faintly of aloe. The jar and its contents weigh 1/2 pound.

As an action, one dose of the ointment can be swallowed or applied to the skin. The creature that receives it regains 2d8 + 2 hit points, ceases to be poisoned, and is cured of any disease.

## Lantern of Revealing
Wondrous Item
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, uncommon*

While lit, this hooded lantern burns for 6 hours on 1 pint of oil, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Invisible creatures and objects are visible as long as they are in the lantern's bright light. You can use an action to lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius.

## Living Gloves
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Eberron - Rising from the Last War

*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

These symbiotic gloves — made of thin chitin and sinew — pulse with a life of their own. To attune to them, you must wear them for the entire attunement period, during which the gloves bond with your skin.

While attuned to these gloves, you gain one of the following proficiencies (your choice when you attune to the gloves):

* Sleight of Hand
* Thieves' tools
* One kind of artisan's tools of your choice
* One kind of musical instrument of your choice

When you make an ability check using the chosen proficiency, you add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus.

***Symbiotic Nature.*** The gloves can't be removed from you while you're attuned to them, and you can't voluntarily end your attunement to them. If you're targeted by a spell that ends a curse, your attunement to the gloves ends, and they can be removed.

## Lorehold Primer
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Strixhaven: A Curriculum of Chaos

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement by a Spellcaster)*

The *Lorehold Primer* is a magic textbook created at Strixhaven's Lorehold College. The primer has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you make an Intelligence (History) or Intelligence (Religion) check while holding the primer, you can expend 1 charge to give yourself 1d4 bonus to the check, immediately after you roll the d20.

In addition, if you study the primer at the end of a long rest, you can choose one 1st-level spell from the [Cleric](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spells:cleric) or [Wizard](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spells:wizard) spell list. Before you finish your next long rest, you can cast the chosen spell once without a spell slot if you are holding the primer. Your spellcasting ability for this spell is your choice of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma.

## Mariner's Armor
Armor

*Armor (light, medium, or heavy), uncommon*

While wearing this armor, you have a swimming speed equal to your walking speed. In addition, whenever you start your turn underwater with 0 hit points, the armor causes you to rise 60 feet toward the surface. The armor is decorated with fish and shell motifs.

## Mask of the Beast
Wondrous Item
Source: Tomb of Annihilation

*Wondrous item, uncommon*

This wooden mask is shaped in the likeness of a beast's visage and has 3 charges. While wearing the mask, you can expend 1 charge and use the mask to cast the [Animal Friendship](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:animal-friendship) spell as an action. The mask regains all expended charges at dawn.

## Mind Carapace Armor
Armor (Attuned)
Source: Volo's Guide to Monsters

*Armor (any heavy armor), uncommon (requires attunement by a specific individual)*

Any nonmagical suit of heavy armor can be turned by mind flayers into *mind carapace armor*. Only one creature can attune to it: either a specific mind flayer or one of its thralls. While worn by any other creature, the *mind carapace armor* functions as normal armor of its kind. To its intended wearer, the armor grants advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws and makes its wearer immune to the frightened condition.

## Mind Crystal
Wondrous Item
Source: Phandelver and Below - The Shattered Obelisk

*Wondrous Item, Rarity Varies*

These gemstones contain a crystallized bit of spellcasting magic. Different types of mind crystals exist, each with a different single-use effect.

When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action while holding a mind crystal, you can modify the spell in a specific way that has an effect described below. You can use only a single mind crystal to modify the spell, and you can’t use a mind crystal and a Metamagic option on the same spell. Once you use a mind crystal, it becomes a nonmagical gem worth 50 gp.

**Careful (Uncommon).** Choose up to three creatures affected by the spell. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell.

**Distant (Uncommon).** If the spell has a range of 5 feet or more and doesn’t have a range of self, the spell’s range increases by 100 feet. If the spell has a range of touch, its range becomes 30 feet.

**Empowered (Uncommon).** When you roll damage for the spell, you can reroll up to three damage dice. You must use the new rolls.

**Extended (Uncommon).** If the spell has a duration of 1 minute or longer, double the spell’s duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.

**Heightened (Rare).** Choose one creature affected by the spell. That creature has disadvantage on the first saving throw it makes against the spell.

**Quickened (Rare).** You change the spell’s casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.

**Subtle (Common).** You cast the spell without any somatic or verbal components for this casting.

## Mithral Armor
Armor
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Armor (medium or heavy), uncommon*

Mithral is a light, flexible metal. A mithral chain shirt or breastplate can be worn under normal clothes. If the armor normally imposes disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks or has a Strength requirement, the mithral version of the armor doesn't.

## Mizzium Apparatus
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica

*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*

Innovation is a dangerous pursuit, at least the way the mages of the Izzet League engage in it. As protection against the risk of an experiment going awry, they have developed a device to help channel and control their magic. This apparatus is a collection of leather straps, flexible tubing, glass cylinders, and plates, bracers, and fittings made from a magic-infused metal alloy called mizzium, all assembled into a harness. The item weighs 8 pounds.

While you are wearing the *mizzium apparatus*, you can use it as an arcane focus. In addition, you can attempt to cast a spell that you do not know or have prepared. The spell you choose must be on your class's spell list and of a level for which you have a spell slot, and you must provide the spell's components.

You expend a spell slot to cast the spell as normal, but before resolving it you must make an Intelligence (Arcana) check. The DC is 10 + twice the level of the spell slot you expend to cast the spell.

On a successful check, you cast the spell as normal, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability modifier. On a failed check, you cast a different spell from the one you intended. Randomly determine the spell you cast by rolling on the table for the level of the spell slot you expended. If the slot is 6th level or higher, roll on the table for 5th-level spells.

If you try to cast a cantrip you don't know, the DC for the Intelligence (Arcana) check is 10, and on a failed check, there is no effect.

## Moon Sickle
Weapon (Attuned)
Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything

*Weapon (sickle), uncommon (+1), rare (+2), very rare (+3) (requires attunement by a druid or ranger)*

This silver-bladed sickle glimmers softly with moonlight. While holding this magic weapon, you gain a bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it, and you gain a bonus to spell attack rolls and the saving throw DCs of your druid and ranger spells. The bonus is determined by the weapon's rarity. In addition, you can use the sickle as a spellcasting focus for your druid and ranger spells.

When you cast a spell that restores hit points, you can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the amount of hit points restored, provided you are holding the sickle.

## Mummy Rot Antidote

White dust swirls constantly within this pale gray potion. When you drink the potion, it cures you of mummy rot.

## Nature's Mantle
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything

*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a druid or ranger)*

This cloak shifts color and texture to blend with the terrain surrounding you. While wearing the cloak, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your druid and ranger spells.

While you are in an area that is lightly obscured, you can Hide as a bonus action even if you are being directly observed.

## Necklace of Adaptation
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

While wearing this necklace, you can breathe normally in any environment, and you have advantage on saving throws made against harmful gases and vapors (such as [Cloudkill](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:cloudkill) and [Stinking Cloud](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:stinking-cloud) effects, inhaled poisons, and the breath weapons of some dragons).

## Night Caller
Wondrous Item
Source: Tales from the Yawning Portal

*Wondrous item, uncommon*

This whistle is carved from transparent crystal, and it resembles a tiny dragon curled up like a snail. The name Night Caller is etched on the whistle in Dwarvish runes. If a character succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana or History) check, the character recalls lore that says the duergar made several such whistles for various groups in an age past.

If you blow the whistle in darkness or under the night sky, it allows you to cast the [Animate Dead](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:animate-dead) spell. The target can be affected through up to 10 feet of soft earth or similar material, and if it is, it takes 1 minute to claw its way to the surface to serve you. Once the whistle has animated an undead creature, it can't do so again until 7 days have passed.

Once every 24 hours, you can blow the whistle to reassert control over one or two creatures you animated with it

## Oil of Slipperiness
Potion
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Potion, uncommon*

This sticky black unguent is thick and heavy in the container, but it flows quickly when poured. The oil can cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment it's wearing and carrying (one additional vial is required for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of a [Freedom of Movement](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:freedom-of-movement) spell for 8 hours.

Alternatively, the oil can be poured on the ground as an action, where it covers a 10-foot square, duplicating the effect of the [Grease](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:grease) spell in that area for 8 hours.

## Paper Bird
Wondrous Item
Source: Waterdeep - Dragon Heist

*Wondrous item, uncommon*

After you write a message of fifty words or fewer on this magic sheet of parchment and speak a creature's name, the parchment magically folds into a Tiny paper bird and flies to the recipient whose name you uttered. The recipient must be on the same plane of existence as you, otherwise the bird turns into ash as it takes flight.

The bird is an object that has 1 hit point, an Armor Class of 13, a flying speed of 60 feet, a Dexterity of 16 (+3), and a score of 1 (-5) in all other abilities, and it is immune to poison and psychic damage.

It travels to within 5 feet of its intended recipient by the most direct route, whereupon it turns into a nonmagical and inanimate sheet of parchment that can be unfolded only by the intended recipient. If the bird's hit points or speed is reduced to 0 or if it is otherwise immobilized, it turns into ash.

*Paper Birds* usually come in small, flat boxes containing 1d6 + 3 sheets of the parchment.

## Pearl of Power
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*

While this pearl is on your person, you can use an action to speak its command word and regain one expended spell slot. If the expended slot was of 4th level or higher, the new slot is 3rd level. Once you have used the pearl, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Periapt of Health
Wondrous Item

You are immune to contracting any disease while you wear this pendant. If you are already infected with a disease, the effects of the disease are suppressed while you wear the pendant.

## Periapt of Wound Closure
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

While you wear this pendant, you stabilize whenever you are dying at the start of your turn. In addition, whenever you roll a Hit Die to regain hit points, double the number of hit points it restores.

## Philter of Love
Potion
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Potion, uncommon*

The next time you see a creature within 10 minutes after drinking this philter, you become charmed by that creature for 1 hour. If the creature is of a species and gender you are normally attracted to, you regard it as your true love while you are charmed. This potion's rose-hued, effervescent liquid contains one easy-to-miss bubble shaped like a heart.

## Pipes of Haunting
Wondrous Item
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, uncommon*

You must be proficient with wind instruments to use these pipes. They have 3 charges. You can use an action to play them and expend 1 charge to create an eerie, spellbinding tune. Each creature within 30 feet of you that hears you play must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. If you wish, all creatures in the area that aren't hostile toward you automatically succeed on the saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw can repeat it at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to the effect of these pipes for 24 hours. The pipes regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.

## Pipes of the Sewers
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

You must be proficient with wind instruments to use these pipes. While you are attuned to the pipes, ordinary rats and giant rats are indifferent toward you and will not attack you unless you threaten or harm them.

The pipes have 3 charges. If you play the pipes as an action, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 to 3 charges, calling forth one swarm of rats (see the *Monster Manual* for statistics) with each expended charge, provided that enough rats are within half a mile of you to be called in this fashion (as determined by the DM). If there aren't enough rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted. Called swarms move toward the music by the shortest available route but aren't under your control otherwise. The pipes regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.

Whenever a swarm of rats that isn't under another creature's control comes within 30 feet of you while you are playing the pipes, you can make a Charisma check contested by the swarm's Wisdom check. If you lose the contest, the swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours. If you win the contest, the swarm is swayed by the pipes' music and becomes friendly to you and your companions for as long as you continue to play the pipes each round as an action. A friendly swarm obeys your commands. If you issue no commands to a friendly swarm, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. If a friendly swarm starts its turn and can't hear the pipes' music, your control over that swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours.

## Piwafwi
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Out of the Abyss

*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

This dark spider-silk cloak is made by drow. It is a [Cloak of Elvenkind](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:cloak-of-elvenkind). It loses its magic if exposed to sunlight for 1 hour without interruption.

## Pixie Dust
Wondrous Item
Source: The Wild Beyond The Witchlight

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

As an action, you can sprinkle this dust on yourself or another creature you can see within 5 feet of you. The recipient gains a flying speed of 30 feet and the ability to hover for 1 minute. If the creature is airborne when this effect ends, it falls safely to the ground, taking no damage and landing on its feet.

A small packet holds enough *pixie dust* for one use.

## Plate Of Knight's Fellowship
Armor (Attuned)
Source: The Book of Many Things

*Armor (plate), uncommon (requires attunement)*

This gleaming set of silver-and-gold plate armor never tarnishes.

While wearing this armor, you can use a bonus action to summon the spirit of a warrior to your aid. The spirit’s corporeal form manifests in an unoccupied space of your choice within 30 feet of you, and it uses the knight stat block. The spirit disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or after 1 minute, whichever comes first.

The spirit is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the spirit shares your initiative count but takes its turn immediately after yours. The spirit obeys your commands (no action required by you); if you don’t issue any commands, the spirit takes the Dodge action and uses its movement to avoid danger.

Once this bonus action is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

## Portal Compass
Wondrous Item
Source: Planescape - Adventures in the Multiverse

*Wondrous item, Uncommon*

This portable arcane instrument points in the direction of the last portal it passed through while it and the portal are on the same plane of existence. If that portal no longer exists, the needle becomes static until the compass passes through a new portal.

## Potion of Advantage
Potion
Source: The Wild Beyond The Witchlight

*Potion, uncommon*

When you drink this potion, you can cast the [Animal Friendship](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:animal-friendship) spell (save DC 13) for 1 hour at will. Agitating this muddy liquid brings little bits into view: a fish scale, a hummingbird tongue, a cat claw, or a squirrel hair.

## Potion of Fire Breath
Potion
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Potion, uncommon*

After drinking this potion, you can use a bonus action to exhale fire at a target within 30 feet of you. The target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The effect ends after you exhale the fire three times or when 1 hour has passed.

This potion's orange liquid flickers, and smoke fills the top of the container and wafts out whenever it is opened.

## Potion of Giant Strength
Potion
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Potion, uncommon*

This concoction looks, smells, and tastes like a [Potion of Healing](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:potion-of-healing) or other beneficial potion. However, it is actually poison masked by illusion magic. An [Identify](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:identify) spell reveals its true nature.

If you drink it, you take 3d6 poison damage, and you must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned. At the start of each of your turns while you are poisoned in this way, you take 3d6 poison damage. At the end of each of your turns, you can repeat the saving throw. On a successful save, the poison damage you take on your subsequent turns decreases by 1d6. The poison ends when the damage decreases to 0.

## Prehistoric Figurines of Wondrous Power
Wondrous Item
Source: Bigby Presents - Glory of the Giants

*Wondrous Item, Varies*

Larger and more roughly hewn than typical figurines of wondrous power, these statuettes depict dinosaurs and related creatures from the earliest days of the world.

As an action, you can throw a prehistoric figurine of wondrous power to a point on the ground within 60 feet of yourself while speaking a command word, whereupon the figurine magically transforms into a living creature. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn’t enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn’t become a creature.

The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions. See the *Monster Manual* for the creature’s statistics.

The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its statuette form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can’t be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine’s description.

**Carnelian Triceratops (Very Rare).** This figurine becomes a triceratops for up to 6 hours and can be ridden as a mount. Once it has been used, it can’t be used again until 10 days have passed.

**Jasper Tyrannosaurus Rex (Legendary).** This figurine, crafted from rare green jasper, becomes a tyrannosaurus rex for up to 1 hour. Once it has been used, it can’t be used again until 14 days have passed.

Whenever you command the figurine while it’s in tyrannosaurus rex form (including commanding it to revert to figurine form), you must roll a d20. On a 1, you lose control of the figurine, and it becomes hostile to you and your companions until it is reduced to 0 hit points, at which point it reverts to figurine form.

**Kyanite Pteranodon (Rare).** This figurine becomes a pteranodon for up to 8 hours. If your size is Medium or smaller, you can ride the pteranodon as a mount. Once it has been used, it can’t be used again until 7 days have passed.

**Pyrite Plesiosaurus (Uncommon).** This figurine becomes a plesiosaurus for up to 12 hours and can be ridden as a mount. Once it has been used, it can’t be used again until 4 days have passed.

While you are riding the plesiosaurus, you can use it to cast [Water Breathing](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:water-breathing) at will.

## Seeker Dart
Weapon
Source: Princes of the Apocalypse

*Weapon (dart), uncommon*

This small dart is decorated with designs like windy spirals that span the length of its shaft.

When you whisper the word “seek” and hurl this dart, it seeks out a target of your choice within 120 feet of you. You must have seen the target before, but you don’t need to see it now. If the target isn’t within range or if there is no clear path to it, the dart falls to the ground, its magic spent and wasted. Otherwise, elemental winds guide the dart instantly through the air to the target. The dart can pass though openings as narrow as 1 inch wide and can change direction to fly around corners.

When the dart reaches its target, the target must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage and 3d4 lightning damage. The dart’s magic is then spent, and it becomes an ordinary dart.

**Record Sensation.** You can use your reaction to record a short sensation lasting no longer than 6 seconds experienced by a creature of your choice within 30 feet of yourself, infusing the essence of the experience into the stone. This replaces any sensation already stored within the stone.

Casting [Dispel Magic](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:dispel-magic) on *Smokepowder* renders it permanently inert.

## Soul Coin
Wondrous Item
Source: Baldur's Gate - Descent into Avernus

*Wondrous item, uncommon*

*Soul coins* are about 5 inches across and about an inch thick, minted from infernal iron. Each coin weighs one-third of a pound, and is inscribed with Infernal writing and a spell that magically binds a single soul to the coin. Because each *soul coin* has a unique soul trapped within it, each has a story. A creature might have been imprisoned as a result of defaulting on a deal, while another might be the victim of a night hag's curse.

***Carrying Soul Coins.*** To hold a *soul coin* is to feel the soul bound within it — overcome with rage or fraught with despair.

An evil creature can carry as many *soul coins* as it wishes (up to its maximum weight allowance). A nonevil creature can carry a number of *soul coins* equal to or less than its Constitution modifier without penalty. A non-evil creature carrying a number of *soul coins* greater than its Constitution modifier has disadvantage on its attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.

***Using a Soul Coin.*** A *soul coin* has 3 charges. A creature carrying the coin can use its action to expend 1 charge from a *soul coin* and use it to do one of the following:

* ***Drain Life.*** You siphon away some of the soul's essence and gain 1d10 temporary hit points.
* ***Query.*** You telepathically ask the soul a question and receive a brief telepathic response. which you can understand. The soul knows only what it knew in life, but it must answer you truthfully and to the best of its ability. The answer is no more than a sentence or two and might be cryptic.

***Freeing a Soul.*** Casting a spell that removes a curse on a *soul coin* frees the soul trapped within it, as does expending all of the coin's charges. The coin itself rusts from within and is destroyed once the soul is released. A freed soul travels to the realm of the god it served or the outer plane most closely tied to its alignment (DM's choice). The souls of lawful evil creatures released from *soul coins* typically emerge from the River Styx as lemure devils.

A soul can also be freed by destroying the coin that contains it. A *soul coin* has AC 19, 1 hit point for each charge it has remaining, and immunity to all damage except that which is dealt by a hellfire weapon (BG:DA, page 223) or an infernal war machine's furnace (BG:DA, page 217).

Freeing a soul from a *soul coin* is considered a good act, even if the soul belongs to an evil creature.

***Hellish Currency.*** *Soul coins* are a currency of the Nine Hells and are highly valued by devils. The coins are used among the infernal hierarchy to barter for favors, bribe the unwilling. and reward the faithful for services rendered.

*Soul coins* are created by Mammon and his greater devils on Minauros, the third layer of the Nine Hells, in a vast chamber where the captured souls of evil mortals are bound into the coins. These coins are then distributed throughout the Nine Hells to be used for goods and services, infernal deals, dark bargains, and bribes.

## Spell Gem
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Out of the Abyss

*Wondrous item, rarity varies (attunement optional)*

A *spell gem* can contain one spell from any class's spell list. You become aware of the spell when you learn the gems properties. While holding the gem. you can cast the spell from it as an action if you know the spell or if the spell is on your class spell list. Doing so doesn‘t require any components and doesn't require attunement. The spell then disappears from the gem.

If the spell is of a higher level than you can normally cast. you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a failed check. the spell disappears from the gem with no other effect.

Each *spell gem* has a maximum level for the spell it can store. The spell level determines the gems rarity and the stored spell's saving throw DC and attack bonus. as shown in the Spell Gem table.

You can imbue the gem with a spell if you're attuned to it and it's empty. To do so, you cast the spell while holding the gem. The spell is stored in the gem instead of having any effect. Casting the spell must require either 1 action or 1 minute or longer, and the spell's level must be no higher than the gem's maximum. If the spell belongs to the school of abjuration and requires material components that are consumed. you must provide them. but they can be worth half as much as normal.

Once imbued with a spell. the gem can't be imbued again until the next dawn.

Deep gnomes created these magic gemstones and keep the creation process a secret.

*Scroll, rarity varies*

A *spell scroll* bears the words of a single spell, written in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class’s spell list, you can read the scroll and cast its spell without providing any material components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible. Casting the spell by reading the scroll requires the spell’s normal casting time. Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and it crumbles to dust. If the casting is interrupted, the scroll is not lost.

If the spell is on your class's spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect.

Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and the scroll itself crumbles to dust.

The level of the spell on the scroll determines the spell's saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as the scroll's rarity, as shown in the Spell Scroll table.

Once used, the fan shouldn't be used again until the next dawn. Each time it is used again before then, it has a cumulative 20 percent chance of not working and tearing into useless, nonmagical tatters.

## Winged Boots
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

While you wear these boots, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can use the boots to fly for up to 4 hours, all at once or in several shorter flights, each one using a minimum of 1 minute from the duration. If you are flying when the duration expires, you descend at a rate of 30 feet per round until you land.

The boots regain 2 hours of flying capability for every 12 hours they aren't in use.

## Wingwear
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Princes of the Apocalypse

*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

This snug uniform has symbols of air stitched into it and leathery flaps that stretch along the arms, waist, and legs to create wings for gliding. A suit of *Wingwear* has 3 charges. While you wear the suit, you can use a bonus action and expend 1 charge to gain a flying speed of 30 feet until you land. At the end of each of your turns, your altitude drops by 5 feet. Your altitude drops instantly to 0 feet at the end of your turn if you didn’t fly at least 30 feet horizontally on that turn. When your altitude drops to 0 feet, you land (or fall), and you must expend another charge to use the suit again.

The suit regains all of its expended charges after spending at least 1 hour in an elemental air node.

## Witherbloom Primer
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source: Strixhaven: A Curriculum of Chaos

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement by a Spellcaster)*

The *Witherbloom Primer* is a magic textbook created at Strixhaven's Witherbloom College. The primer has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you make an Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Survival) check while holding the primer, you can expend 1 charge to give yourself a 1d4 bonus to the check, immediately after you roll the d20.

In addition, if you study the primer at the end of a long rest, you can choose one 1st-level spell from the [Druid](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spells:druid) or [Wizard](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spells:wizard) spell list. Before you finish your next long rest, you can cast the chosen spell once without a spell slot if you are holding the primer. Your spellcasting ability for this spell is your choice of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma.
