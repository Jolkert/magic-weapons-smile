Source: Bigby Presents - Glory of the Giants

*Weapon (Greataxe), Artifact (Requires Attunement)*

This massive adze is said to have been wielded by All-Father Annam, not as a weapon but as the tool he used to shape the various worlds of the Material Plane eons ago.

**Random Properties.** The adze has the following random properties, determined by rolling on the appropriate table in the *Dungeon Master’s Guide*:

* 2 minor beneficial properties
* 1 major beneficial property
* 2 minor detrimental properties

**Magic Weapon.** When a creature attunes to the adze, the artifact magically adjusts its size so that creature can wield it as a greataxe. The adze is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. On a hit, the adze deals an additional 3d12 force damage. It also deals double damage to objects and structures.

**Divine Mattock.** As an action, you can call upon the might of the All-Father and use the adze to cast [Move Earth](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:move-earth) or [Fabricate](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:fabricate). Once this property is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

## Akmon, Hammer of Purphoros
Source: Mythic Odysseys of Theros

*Weapon (warhammer), artifact (requires attunement)*

Purphoros's hammer works wonders and disasters, the god of the forge using it to craft ground-breaking marvels and dangerous inventions in equal measure. Purphoros rarely bestows *Akmon* on mortals but occasionally leaves it unattended at his forge in Mount Velus. When Purphoros does permit a mortal to use the hammer, it's usually so they might bring an important work into being, wreck a force of destruction, or forge something remarkable somewhere the god isn't welcome.

***Hammer of the Forge.*** This magic warhammer grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. When you hit with an attack using it, the target takes an extra 3d10 fire damage.

***Blessing of the Forge.*** If you are a worshiper of Purphoros, you gain all the following benefits for which you have the required piety:

* **Piety 10+.** The hammer has 1 randomly determined minor beneficial property.
* **Piety 25+.** The hammer has 1 randomly determined major beneficial property.
* **Piety 50+.** The hammer has 1 additional randomly determined major beneficial property.

If you aren't a worshiper of Purphoros, the hammer has 2 randomly determined minor detrimental properties.

See "Artifacts" in chapter 7 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide* for details on randomly determined properties.

***Reforged.*** While holding the hammer, you have resistance to fire damage and are immune to exhaustion. Additionally, you have proficiency with smith's tools and have advantage on all ability checks made using them.

***Spells.*** While the hammer is on your person, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18): [Animate Objects](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:animate-objects), [Heat Metal](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:heat-metal), [Fabricate](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:fabricate), [Magic Weapon](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:magic-weapon), [Mending](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:mending), [Shatter](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:shatter). Once you use the hammer to cast a spell, the spell can't be cast again from it until the next dusk.

***Destroying the Hammer.*** To destroy the hammer, it must be taken to the realm of Tizerus, in the Underworld. There it must be coated in clay from the Mire of Punishment. The heat of the hammer hardens the clay, which fuses to it after one month. Once fully hardened, the clay-covered hammer must be swallowed and digested by a kraken.

## Axe of the Dwarvish Lords
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Weapon (battleaxe), artifact (requires attunement)*

Seeing the peril his people faced, a young dwarf prince came to believe that his people needed something to unite them. Thus, he set out to forge a weapon that would be such a symbol.

Venturing deep under the mountains, deeper than any dwarf had ever delved, the young prince came to the blazing heart of a great volcano. With the aid of Moradin, the dwarven god of creation, he first crafted four great tools: the *Brutal Pick*, the *Earthheart Forge*, the *Anvil of Songs*, and the *Shaping Hammer*. With them, he forged the *Axe of the Dwarvish Lords*.

Armed with the artifact, the prince returned to the dwarf clans and brought peace. His axe ended grudges and answered slights. The clans became allies, and they threw back their enemies and enjoyed an era of prosperity. This young dwarf is remembered as the First King. When he became old, he passed the weapon, which had become his badge of office, to his heir. The rightful inheritors passed the axe on for many generations.

Later, in a dark era marked by treachery and wickedness, the axe was lost in a bloody civil war fomented by greed for its power and the status it bestowed. Centuries later, the dwarves still search for the axe, and many adventurers have made careers of chasing after rumors and plundering old vaults to find it.

**Magic Weapon.** The *Axe of the Dwarvish Lords* is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The axe also functions as a [Belt of Dwarvenkind](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:belt-of-dwarvenkind), a [Dwarven Thrower](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:dwarven-thrower), and a [Sword of Sharpness](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:sword-of-sharpness).

**Random Properties.** The axe has the following randomly determined properties:

* 2 minor beneficial properties
* 1 major beneficial property
* 2 minor detrimental properties

**Blessings of Moradin.** If you are a dwarf attuned to the axe, you gain the following benefits:

* You have immunity to poison damage.
* The range of your darkvision increases by 60 feet.
* You gain proficiency with artisan's tools related to blacksmithing, brewing, and stonemasonry.

**Conjure Earth Elemental.** If you are holding the axe, you can use your action to cast the [Conjure Elemental](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:conjure-elemental) spell from it, summoning an earth elemental. You can't use this property again until the next dawn.

**Travel the Depths.** You can use an action to touch the axe to a fixed piece of dwarven stonework and cast the teleport spell from the axe. If your intended destination is underground, there is no chance of a mishap or arriving somewhere unexpected. You can't use this property again until 3 days have passed.

**Curse.** The axe bears a curse that affects any nondwarf that becomes attuned to it. Even if the attunement ends, the curse remains. With each passing day, the creature's physical appearance and stature become more dwarflike. After seven days, the creature looks like a typical dwarf, but the creature neither loses its racial traits nor gains the racial traits of a dwarf. The physical changes wrought by the axe aren't considered magical in nature (and therefore can't be dispelled), but they can be undone by any effect that removes a curse, such as a [Greater Restoration](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:greater-restoration) or [Remove Curse](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:remove-curse) spell.

**Destroying the Axe.** The only way to destroy the axe is to melt it down in the *Earthheart Forge*, where it was created. It must remain in the burning forge for fifty years before it finally succumbs to the fire and is consumed.

## Baba Yaga's Mortar and Pestle
Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything

*Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)*

The creations of the immortal hag Baba Yaga defy the laws of mortal magic. Among the notorious implements that cement her legend on countless worlds are the artifacts that propel her through the planes: *Baba Yaga's Mortar and Pestle*. These signature tools of Baba Yaga are a single artifact for purposes of attunement. Should the two objects become separated, the pestle appears next to the mortar at the next dawn.

***Random Properties.*** This artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the "Artifacts" section of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*:

* 2 minor beneficial properties
* 1 major beneficial property
* 1 minor detrimental property

***Properties of the Mortar.*** The mortar is a Tiny wooden bowl. However, the mortar increases in size to accommodate anything you place inside, expanding — if there's enough space — up to Large size, meaning it can hold even a Large creature.

***Properties of the Pestle.*** The pestle is a 6-inchlong, worn wooden tool. Once during your turn while you are holding the pestle, you can extend it into a quarterstaff or shrink it back into a pestle (no action required). As a quarterstaff, the pestle is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

The pestle has 12 charges. When you hit with a melee attack using the pestle, you can expend up to 3 of its charges to deal an extra 1d8 force damage for each charge expended. The pestle regains all expended charges daily at dawn.

***Perfect Tools.*** While holding the mortar and pestle, you can use your action to say the name of any nonmagical plant, mineral, or fluid and an amount of the material worth 10 gp or less. The mortar instantly fills with the desired amount of that material. Once you use this action, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

You can also use the artifact as alchemist's supplies, brewer's supplies, cook's utensils, an herbalism kit, and a poisoner's it. You have advantage on any check you make using the artifact as one of these tools.

***Primal Parts.*** As an action while the pestle and the mortar is within 5 feet of you, you can command the pestle to grind. For the next minute, or until you use your action to verbally command it to stop, the pestle moves on its own, grinding the contents of the mortar into a mush or fine powder that's equally useful for cooking or alchemy. At the start of each of your turns, whatever is in the mortar takes 4dl0 force damage. If this reduces the target's hit points to 0, the target is reduced to powder, pulp, or paste, as appropriate. Only magic items are unaffected. If you wish, when the pestle stops, you can have the mortar separate its contents — like powdered bone, crushed herbs, pulped organs — into separate piles.

***Traverse the Night.*** If you are holding the pestle while you are inside the mortar, you can use your action to verbally command the mortar to travel to a specific place or creature. You don't need to know where your destination is, but it must be a specific destination — not just the nearest river or a red dragon's lair. If the stated destination is within 1,000 miles of you, the mortar lifts into the air and vanishes. You and any creatures in the mortar travel through a dreamlike sky, with hazy reflections of the world passing by below. Creatures might see images of you streaking through the sky between your point of origin and the destination. You arrive at the location 1 hour later or, if it is night, 1 minute later.

***Bones Know Their Home.*** When you command the mortar to travel, you can instead throw out the dust or paste of something ground by the mortar and name a location on a different plane of existence or a different world on the Material Plane. If that material came from a creature native to the named plane or world, the mortar travels through an empty night sky to an unoccupied space at that destination, arriving in 1 minute.

***Destroying the Mortar and Pestle.*** The mortar and pestle are destroyed if they are crushed underfoot by the *Dancing Hut of Baba Yaga* or by Baba Yaga herself.

## Bigby's Beneficent Bracelet
Source: Bigby Presents - Glory of the Giants

*Wondrous Item, Artifact (Requires Attunement)*

This gorgeous jewelry piece, crafted by the wizard Bigby himself, consists of four gold rings attached via delicate chains to a wrist cuff studded with sapphires and diamonds.

**Random Properties.** The bracelet has the following random properties, determined by rolling on the appropriate table in the *Dungeon Master’s Guide*:

* 1 minor beneficial property
* 1 major beneficial property
* 1 minor detrimental property

**Dexterous Fingers.** While wearing the bracelet, you can cast [Mage Hand](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:mage-hand).

**Force Sculpture.** By focusing and channeling the bracelet’s magic for 1 minute, you can create a spectral copy of a Large or smaller nonmagical object. The copy appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you, and it is made of tangible but translucent force that mimics the size, weight, and other properties of the object it’s copying. The copy must appear on a surface or liquid that can support it. Creatures can touch and interact with the copy as if it were a nonmagical object.

The copy is immune to all damage and can’t be dispelled, but a [Disintegrate](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:disintegrate) spell destroys it immediately. Otherwise, the copy disappears after 8 hours or when you dismiss it as an action.

The bracelet can create up to three copies and regains all expended uses at dawn.

**Helpful Hand.** As an action, you can use the bracelet to cast [Bigby's Hand](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:bigbys-hand) as a 9th-level spell (spell attack bonus +13). When you cast the spell this way, the spell doesn’t require concentration. Once this property is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

## Blade of Avernus
Source: Baldur's Gate - Descent into Avernus

*Weapon (longsword), artifact (requires attunement)*

**Magic Weapon.** The Blade of Avernus is a magic weapon that functions as a vorpal sword.

**Random Properties.** The sword has the following randomly determined properties, as described in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide:

* 2 minor beneficial properties
* 1 major beneficial property
* 1 major detrimental property, which is suppressed while the sword is attuned to an archdevil

**Ruler of Avernus.** As an action, you can point this sword at one devil you can see within 60 feet of you. That devil must succeed on a DC 22 Charisma saving throw or be charmed by you for 1 hour. While charmed in this way, the devil follows your orders to the best of its ability. If you command the devil to do something it perceives as suicidal, the effect ends and you can no longer use this power of the sword against that devil.

**Infernal Recall.** As an action, you can use the sword to cast [Word of Recall](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:word-of-recall). Creatures transported by this spell appear in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of the current ruler of Avernus, or a sanctuary you designate if you rule Avernus.

**Destroying the Sword.** The sword can be destroyed by casting it into the River Styx or melting it down in the forge that created it.

## Blade of Broken Mirrors
Source: Explorer's Guide to Wildemount

*Weapon (dagger), artifact (requires attunement by a humanoid)*

A weapon of Tharizdun, this dagger is a piece of jagged stone whose blade is scribed with a maze-like pattern with no beginning or end.

***Sentience.*** The *Blade of Broken Mirrors* is a sentient chaotic evil weapon with an Intelligence of 21, a Wisdom of 24, and a Charisma of 24. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Abyssal and Common.

***Personality.*** An insane glabrezu named Ragazuu lives within the *Blade of Broken Mirrors*. The weapon yearns to cause chaos. It learns its wielder's principles, then uses those ideals to encourage reckless action. The dagger whispers ideas of revolution.

***Dormant.*** The dagger grants the following benefits in its dormant state:

* You can speak, read, and write Abyssal.
* You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Immediately after you make a ranged attack with this weapon, it returns to your hand.
* Whenever you kill a humanoid with an attack using the *Blade of Broken Mirrors*, the blade remembers the creature's appearance. While holding the dagger, you can use an action to change your form to match any humanoid the blade remembers. Your statistics, other than your size, don't change. Any equipment you are wearing or carrying isn't transformed. You can revert to your true appearance as an action. You revert to your true appearance automatically when you die.
  * When the *Blade of Broken Mirrors* attunes to a new wielder, the appearances of humanoids it has killed are wiped from its memory.

***Awakened.*** When the dagger reaches an awakened state, it gains the following properties:

* The weapon's bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +2.
* While holding the weapon, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it (save DC 15): [Fabricate](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:fabricate), [Hallucinatory Terrain](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:hallucinatory-terrain), [Major Image](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:major-image), or [Phantasmal Killer](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:phantasmal-killer). Once a spell has been cast using the dagger, that spell can't be cast from the dagger again until the next dawn.

***Exalted.*** When the dagger reaches an exalted state, it gains the following properties:

* The weapon's bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +3.
* The saving throw DC for spells cast from the dagger increases to 17.
* While holding the dagger, you can turn invisible as an action. Anything you are wearing or carrying is invisible with you. You remain invisible until you stop holding the dagger, until you attack or cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw, or until you use a bonus action to become visible again.

## Book of Exalted Deeds
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement by a creature of good alignment)*

The definitive treatise on all that is good in the multiverse, the fabled *Book of Exalted Deeds* figures prominently in many religions. Rather than being a scripture devoted to a particular faith, the book's various authors filled the pages with their own vision of true virtue, providing guidance for defeating evil.

The *Book of Exalted Deeds* rarely lingers in one place. As soon as the book is read, it vanishes to some other corner of the multiverse where its moral guidance can bring light to a darkened world. Although attempts have been made to copy the work, efforts to do so fail to capture its magical nature or translate the benefits it offers to those pure of heart and firm of purpose.

A heavy clasp, wrought to look like angel wings, keeps the book's contents secure. Only a creature of good alignment that is attuned to the book can release the clasp that holds it shut. Once the book is opened, the attuned creature must spend 80 hours reading and studying the book to digest its contents and gain its benefits. Other creatures that peruse the book's open pages can read the text but glean no deeper meaning and reap no benefits. An evil creature that tries to read from the book takes 24d6 radiant damage. This damage ignores resistance and immunity, and can't be reduced or avoided by any means. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage disappears in a blinding flash and is destroyed, leaving its possessions behind.

Benefits granted by the *Book of Exalted Deeds* last only as long as you strive to do good. If you fail to perform at least one act of kindness or generosity within the span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform an evil act, you lose all the benefits granted by the book.

***Random Properties.*** The *Book of Exalted Deeds* has the following random properties:

* 2 minor beneficial properties
* 2 major beneficial properties

***Increased Wisdom.*** After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. You can't gain this benefit from the book more than once.

***Enlightened Magic.*** Once you've read and studied the book, any spell slot you expend to cast a cleric or paladin spell counts as a spell slot of one level higher.

***Halo.*** Once you've read and studied the book, you gain a protective halo. This halo sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can dismiss or manifest the halo as a bonus action. While present, the halo gives you advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with good creatures and Charisma (Intimidation) checks made to interact with evil creatures. In addition, fiends and undead within the halo's bright light make attack rolls against you with disadvantage.

***Destroying the Book.*** It is rumored that the *Book of Exalted Deeds* can't be destroyed as long as good exists in the multiverse. However, drowning the book in the River Styx removes all writing and imagery from its pages and renders the book powerless for 1d100 years.

## Book of Vile Darkness
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)*

The contents of this foul manuscript of ineffable wickedness are the meat and drink of those in evil's thrall. No mortal was meant to know the secrets it contains, knowledge so horrid that to even glimpse the scrawled pages invites madness.

Most believe the lich-god Vecna authored the *Book of Vile Darkness*. He recorded in its pages every diseased idea, every unhinged thought, and every example of blackest magic he came across or devised. Vecna covered every vile topic he could, making the book a gruesome catalog of all mortal wrongs.

Other practitioners of evil have held the book and added their own input to its catalog of vile knowledge. Their additions are clear, for the writers of later works stitched whatever they were writing into the tome or, in some cases, made notations and additions to existing text. There are places where pages are missing, torn. or covered so completely with ink, blood, and scratches that the original text can't be divined.

Nature can't abide the book's presence. Ordinary plants wither in its presence, animals are unwilling to approach it, and the book gradually destroys whatever it touches. Even stone cracks and turns to powder if the book rests on it long enough.

A creature attuned to the book must spend 80 hours reading and studying it to digest its contents and reap its benefits. The creature can then freely modify the book's contents, provided that those modifications advance evil and expand the lore already contained within.

Whenever a non-evil creature attunes to the *Book of Vile Darkness*, that creature must make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's alignment changes to neutral evil.

The *Book of Vile Darkness* remains with you only as long as you strive to work evil in the world. If you fail to perform at least one evil act within the span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform a good act, the book disappears. If you die while attuned to the book, an entity of great evil claims your soul. You can't be restored to life by any means while your soul remains imprisoned.

***Random Properties.*** The *Book of Vile Darkness* has the following random properties:

* 3 minor beneficial properties
* 1 major beneficial property
* 3 minor detrimental properties
* 2 major detrimental properties

***Adjusted Ability Scores.*** After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, one ability score of your choice increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. Another ability score of your choice decreases by 2, to a minimum of 3. The book can't adjust your ability scores again.

***Mark of Darkness.*** After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, you acquire a physical disfigurement as a hideous sign of your devotion to vile darkness. An evil rune might appear on your face, your eyes might become glossy black, or horns might sprout from your forehead. Or you might become wizened and hideous, lose all facial features, gain a forked tongue, or some other feature the DM chooses. The mark of darkness grants you advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with evil creatures and Charisma (Intimidation) checks made to interact with non-evil creatures.

***Command Evil.*** While you are attuned to the book and holding it, you can use an action to cast the [Dominate Monster](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:dominate-monster) spell on an evil target (save DC 18). You can't use this property again until the next dawn.

***Dark Lore.*** You can reference the *Book of Vile Darkness* whenever you make an Intelligence check to recall information about some aspect of evil, such as lore about demons. When you do so, double your proficiency bonus on that check.

***Dark Speech.*** While you carry the *Book of Vile Darkness* and are attuned to it, you can use an action to recite word from its pages in a foul language known as Dark Speech. Each time you do so, you take 1d12 psychic damage, and each non-evil creature within 15 feet of you takes 3d6 psychic damage.

***Destroying the Book.*** The *Book of Vile Darkness* allows pages to be torn from it, but any evil lore contained on those pages finds its way back into the book eventually, usually when a new author adds pages to the tome.

If a solar tears the book in two, the book is destroyed for 1d100 years, after which it reforms in some dark corner of the multiverse.

A creature attuned to the book for one hundred years can unearth a phrase hidden in the original text that, when translated to Celestial and spoken aloud, destroys both the speaker and the book in a blinding flash of radiance. However, as long as evil exists in the multiverse, the book reforms 1d10 x 100 years later.

If all evil in the multiverse is wiped out, the book turns to dust and is forever destroyed.

***Circle of Death.*** While attuned to the book, you can cast [Circle of Death](/spell:circle-of-death) (save DC 20) from it as an action. After you cast the spell, roll a d6. On a roll of 1-5, you can't use this property again until the next dawn.

***Condition Immunities.*** While attuned to the book, you can't be charmed or frightened.

***Evil Presence.*** The book houses an evil spirit that is hostile toward you. When you become attuned to the book, the spirit tries to leave the book and enter your body. If you fail a DC 20 Charisma saving throw, it succeeds, and you become an NPC under the DM's control until the intruding spirit is banished using magic such as the [Dispel Evil and Good](/spell:dispel-evil-and-good) spell. The banished spirit returns to the book.

***Adjusted Ability Scores.*** After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, one ability score of your choice increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. Another ability score of your choice decreases by 2, to a minimum of 3. The book can't adjust your ability scores again.

## Crook of Rao
Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything

*Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)*

Ages ago, the serene god Rao created a tool to shield his fledgling faithful against the evils of the Lower Planes. Yet, as eons passed, mortals developed their own methods of dealing with existential threats, and the crook was largely forgotten. In recent ages, though, the *Crook of Rao* was rediscovered and leveraged against the rising power of the Witch Queen Iggwilv (one of the names of the wizard Tasha). Although she was defeated, Iggwilv managed to damage the crook during the battle, infecting it with an insidious curse — and the potential for future victory. In the aftermath, the crook was again lost. Occasionally it reappears, but the famed artifact is not what it was. Whether or not the artifact's bearers realize its full threat, few risk using the *Crook of Rao* — potentially for the final time.

***Random Properties.*** The artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the "Artifacts" section of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*:

* 2 minor beneficial properties
* 1 major beneficial property
* 1 minor detrimental property

***Spells.*** The crook has 6 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: [Aura of Life](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:aura-of-life) (2 charges), [Aura of Purity](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:aura-of-purity) (2 charges), [Banishment](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:banishment) (1 charge), [Beacon of Hope](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:beacon-of-hope) (1 charge), [Mass Cure Wounds](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:mass-cure-wounds) (3 charges). The crook regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.

***Absolute Banishment.*** While you are attuned to the crook and holding it, you can spend 10 minutes to banish all but the mightiest fiends within 1 mile of you. Any fiend with a challenge rating of 19 or higher is unaffected. Each banished fiend is sent back to its home plane and can't return to the plane the *Crook of Rao* banished it from for 100 years.

***Failing Matrix.*** Whenever the Crook of Rao's Absolute Banishment property is used, or when its last charge is expended, roll on the Extraplanar Reversal table. Any creatures conjured as a result of this effect appear in random unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of you and are not under your control.

|Extraplanar Reversal|                                                                                                                                                                    |

***Iggwilv's Curse.*** When the Crook was last used against Iggwilv, the Witch Queen lashed out at the artifact, infecting its magical matrix. Over the years, this curse has spread within the crook, threatening to violently pervert its ancient magic. If this occurs, the *Crook of Rao*, as it is currently known, is destroyed, its magical matrix inverting and exploding into a 50-foot-diameter portal. This portal functions as a permanent gate spell cast by Iggwilv. The gate then, once per round on initiative count 20, audibly speaks a fiend's name in lggwilv's voice, doing so until the gate calls on every fiend ever banished by the *Crook of Rao*. If the fiend still exists, it is drawn through the gate. This process takes eighteen years to complete, at the end of which the gate becomes a permanent portal to Pazunia, the first layer of the Abyss.

***Destroying or Repairing the Crook.*** The *Crook of Rao* can either be destroyed or repaired by journeying to Mount Celestia and obtaining a tear from the eternally serene god Rao. One way to make the emotionless god cry would be to reunite Rao with the spirit of his first worshiper who sought revelations beyond the multiverse long ago. The Crook dissolves if immersed in the god's tear for a year and a day. If washed in the tear daily for 30 days, the Crook loses its Failing Matrix property.

## Crown of Lies
Source: Vecna - Eve of Ruin

*Wondrous Item, Artifact (Requires Attunement)*

After betraying and nearly destroying the lich Vecna, the warrior Kas found himself trapped in the Shadowfell, imprisoned in a Domain of Dread called Tovag. There, he languished as a vampire.  
In time, the Dark Powers of the Shadowfell lured Kas to a hidden forge, where he found the Crown of Lies. Once Kas vowed to deliver Vecna into the Dark Powers’ clutches and donned the crown, the Dark Powers released Kas. From there, Kas set out to ruin his former master. Should Kas fail, the Dark Powers will reclaim him.  
The crown is made of burnished and entwined metal rods. To attune to it, you must place it on your head and speak a true desire of your heart. You know how to attune to the crown when you touch it.

**Random Properties.** The Crown of Lies has the following random properties (see the Dungeon Master’s Guide for options)  
1 minor beneficial property  
1 major beneficial property  
1 minor detrimental property

**Perfect Disguise**. While attuned to the crown, you can use an action to transform yourself to look and feel like any creature you’ve seen at least once and whose size is no more than one size smaller or larger than yours.  
The new form mimics the chosen creature’s appearance exactly, including its voice. Your size and speed are replaced by the chosen creature’s. You otherwise retain your own game statistics. While in this new form, the crown melds into your person and is undetectable.  
Your new form lasts until you die, your attunement to the crown ends, or you use another action to transform into a different creature or your true form. Interactions with you while you are transformed by the crown reveal no illusory magic, nor do they reveal anything other than details about the creature you’re disguised as. You count as the chosen creature for the purposes of spells, traps, and other defenses that wouldn’t target the chosen creature.  
While in your disguised form, any lies you tell always seem to be true, no matter what magical or mundane methods are used to try to detect your falsehoods. You are the recipient of [Sending](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:sending) spells addressed to you and the creature you are disguised as, and Scrying and similar spells that target the creature you are disguised as actually target you. The only way to reveal your true nature while transformed by the crown is with a [Wish](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:wish) spell.  
While wearing this crown in your true form, you can choose for the crown to be visible if you wish.

**Destroying the Crown.** If a creature wearing the crown is killed by the creature it is disguised as, the crown disintegrates and is destroyed.

## Daoud's Wondrous Lantern
Source: Quests from the Infinite Staircase

*Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)*

This artifact destroys wealth to provide light and protection. Wrought from the finest yellow gold, the lantern has four faces, and an unwavering amber flame burns within it. The faces of the lantern are fitted with faceted gemstone lenses.

The lantern is a symbol of the teachings of Daoud, who was once a priest of Istus, a god of fate. When Daoud was stripped of his possessions, he developed a radical new philosophy in his quest to understand fate. He urged followers of his ideology to eschew wealth and seek out all fortunes, good and ill, to unravel the cloth of destiny.

**Random Properties.** The lantern has the following random properties:

* 2 minor beneficial properties
* 1 major beneficial property
* 1 minor detrimental property

**Precious Fuel.** The lantern burns only one source of fuel: powdered gemstones placed in the lantern's base. The lantern can hold a maximum of 10,000 gp worth of powdered gems, and it contains 9,000 gp of fuel when found. Thereafter it attempts to burn 100 gp of fuel after each year passes, keeping the lantern burning for another year. If no fuel is available, the lantern's flame goes out. You can add more fuel to the lantern as part of a short or long rest. Once added, fuel can't be removed from the lantern's base.  
The lantern's flame can't be extinguished by any means other than running out of fuel. If the lantern's flame goes out, the creature attuned to it immediately dies. One exception to this rule exists (see the "Destroying the Lantern" section).

**Revealing Light.** The lantern sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light for an additional 60 feet. Invisible creatures and objects are visible while in the lantern's bright light.  
While attuned to the lantern, you can use a bonus action to dim the lantern, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius, or brighten the lantern back to its normal bright light radius.

**Lenses.** When found, the lantern's faces display the following gem lenses: diamond, emerald, ruby, and sapphire. As part of a short or long rest, you can magically change any of these gem lenses to a different type of gem shown in the Lenses table. The gem lenses can't be removed from the lantern.  
As an action while holding the lantern, you can burn some of the lantern's fuel to cast a spell (save DC 20) through one or more of its current gem lenses, as noted in the Lenses table. The spell's target or point of origin must be in the lantern's area of bright light. If there isn't enough fuel left to cast the spell, the last of the remaining fuel is expended, and the flame goes out.

Lenses  

|  Lens Color   |                              Spell                              |Fuel Cost|
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
|   Amethyst    |[Reverse Gravity](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:reverse-gravity)| 3000gp  |
|    Diamond    |   [Disintegrate](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:disintegrate)   | 2000gp  |
|    Emerald    |          [Haste](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:haste)          |  500gp  |
|    Jacinth    |   [Flame Strike](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:flame-strike)   | 1000gp  |
|     Ruby      |   [Hold Monster](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:hold-monster)   | 1000gp  |
|   Sapphire    |           [Fear](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:fear)           |  500gp  |
|     Topaz     |           [Slow](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:slow)           |  500gp  |
|Any four colors| [Prismatic Wall](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:prismatic-wall) | 5000gp  |

**Destroying the Lantern.** To destroy the lantern, the creature attuned to it must forsake all material possessions except for the lantern and common clothes. Then the creature must willingly snuff the lantern's flame with the intention to destroy the artifact. When its flame is snuffed in this way, the lantern's gold corrodes, the lenses and remaining gemstone fuel turn to worthless sand, and the creature attuned to it is spared.

## Dekella, Bident of Thassa
Source: Mythic Odysseys of Theros

*Weapon (trident), artifact (requires attunement)*

Thassa wields *Dekella*, a two-pronged weapon gifted to her by Purphoros. When the god of the sea bestows her weapon on a mortal, it's often so they might work her will far from the ocean, right some wrong affecting those she'd prefer not to harm, or give a mortal a glimpse of her terrible responsibilities.

***Bident of the Deep.*** Thassa's signature weapon thrums with the icy currents of the deep ocean. This weapon functions as a trident that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. When you hit with an attack using the bident, the target takes an extra 2d10 cold damage.

***Blessing of the Deep.*** If you are a worshiper of Thassa, you gain all the following benefits for which you have the required piety:

* **Piety 10+.** You can breathe underwater, and you gain a swimming speed of 60 feet.
* **Piety 25+.** The bident has 1 randomly determined minor beneficial property.
* **Piety 50+.** The bident has 1 randomly determined major beneficial property.

If you aren't a worshiper of Thassa, the bident has 1 minor detrimental property and 1 major detrimental property, both randomly determined.

See "Artifacts" in chapter 7 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide* for details on randomly determined properties.

***Command the Deep.*** The bident holds the power to command the waves and its creatures. As an action, you can change the condition of the sea within 1 mile of you, creating strong winds and heavy rain that cause violent waves (see "Weather at Sea" in chapter 5 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*) or calming a storm. In either case, the unnatural weather lasts for 1 hour before returning to normal. Once used, this property of the bident can't be used again until the next dusk.

Additionally, you can cast the [Dominate Monster](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:dominate-monster) spell (save DC 18) from the bident, but only on beasts and monstrosities that have an innate swimming speed. Once used, this property of the bident can't be used again until the next dusk.

***Aquatic Metamorphosis.*** You can cast the [True Polymorph](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:true-polymorph) spell (save DC 18) from the bident, but you must cast it on a creature to turn it into a kind of creature that has an innate swimming speed. Once used, this property of the bident can't be used again until the next dusk.

***Destroying the Bident.*** To destroy the bident, it must be heated by the breath of an ancient red dragon and then, while still hot, immersed in the Tartyx River.

## Demonomicon of Iggwilv
Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything

*Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)*

An expansive treatise documenting the Abyss's infinite layers and inhabitants, the *Demonomicon of lggwilv* is the most thorough and blasphemous tome of demonology in the multiverse. The tome recounts both the oldest and most current profanities of the Abyss and demons. Demons have attempted to censor the text, and while sections have been ripped from the book's spine, the general chapters remain, ever revealing demonic secrets. And the book holds more than blasphemies. Caged behind lines of script roils a secret piece of the Abyss itself, which keeps the book up-to-date, no matter how many pages are removed, and it longs to be more than mere reference material.

***Random Properties.*** The artifact has the follow random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the "Artifacts" section of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*:

* 2 minor beneficial properties
* 1 minor detrimental property
* 1 major detrimental property

***Spells.*** The book has 8 charges. It regains 1d8 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding it, you can use an action to cast [Tasha's Hideous Laughter](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:tashas-hideous-laughter) from it or to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 20) from it: [Magic Circle](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:magic-circle) (1 charge), [Magic Jar](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:magic-jar) (3 charges), [Planar Ally](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:planar-ally) (3 charges), [Planar Binding](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:planar-binding) (2 charges), [Plane Shift](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:plane-shift) (to layers of the Abyss only; 3 charges), [Summon Fiend](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:summon-fiend) (3 charges; appears in this book).

***Abyssal Reference.*** You can reference the *Demonomicon* whenever you make an Intelligence check to discern information about demons or a Wisdom (Survival) check related to the Abyss. When you do so, you can add double your proficiency bonus to the check.

***Fiendish Scourging.*** Your magic causes pain to fiends. While carrying the book, when you make a damage roll for a spell you cast against a fiend, you use the maximum possible result instead of rolling.

***Ensnarement.*** While carrying the book, whenever you cast the [Magic Circle](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:magic-circle) spell naming only fiends, or the [Planar Binding](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:planar-binding) spell targeting a fiend, the spell is cast at 9th level, regardless of what level spell slot you used, if any. Additionally, the fiend has disadvantage on its saving throw against the spell.

***Containment.*** The first 10 pages of the *Demonomicon* are blank. As an action while holding the book, you can target a fiend that you can see that is trapped within a [Magic Circle](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:magic-circle). The fiend must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw with disadvantage or become trapped within one of the *Demonomicon*'s empty blank pages, which fills with writing detailing the trapped creature's widely known name and depravities. Once used, this action can't be used again until the next dawn.

When you finish a long rest, if you and the *Demonomicon* are on the same plane of existence, the trapped creature of the highest challenge rating within the book can attempt to possess you. You must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, you are possessed by the creature, which controls you like a puppet. The possessing creature can release you as an action, appearing in the closest unoccupied space. On a successful save, the fiend can't try to possess you again for 7 days.

When the tome is discovered, it has 1d4 fiends occupying its pages, typically an assortment of demons.

***Destroying the Demonomicon.*** To destroy the book, six different demon lords must each tear out a sixth of the book's pages. If this occurs, the pages reappear after 24 hours. Before all those hours pass, anyone who opens the book's remaining binding is transported to a nascent layer of the Abyss that lies hidden within the book. At the heart of this deadly, semi-sentient domain lies a long-lost artifact, Fraz-Urb'luu's Staff. If the staff is dragged from the pocket plane, the tome is reduced to a mundane and quite out-of-date copy of the *Tome of Zyx*, the work that served as the foundation for the *Demonomicon*. Once the staff emerges, the demon lord Fraz-Urb'luu instantly knows.

## Ephixis, Bow of Nyela
Source: Mythic Odysseys of Theros

*Weapon (shortbow), artifact (requires attunement)*

Nylea wields the shortbow *Ephixis*, the bow whose arrows herald the turning of the seasons. Nylea is quick to let her favored followers borrow her bow, particularly when they intend to use it to perform great deeds, put an end to foul creatures, or cast down the arrogant.

***Bow of the Wild.*** This divine weapon includes a shortbow and a quiver with four arrows, each tied to one of the four seasons. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this bow, and you suffer no disadvantage when attacking at the weapon's long range. Additionally, *Ephixis* scores a critical hit on a d20 roll of 19 or 20.

***Blessing of the Wild.*** If you are a worshiper of Nylea, you gain all the following benefits for which you have the required piety:

* **Piety 10+.** The bow has 1 randomly determined minor beneficial property.
* **Piety 25+.** The bow has 1 randomly determined major beneficial property.

If you aren't a worshiper of Nylea, the bow has 1 randomly determined major detrimental property.

See "Artifacts" in chapter 7 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide* for details on randomly determined properties.

***Arrows of the Seasons.*** The four arrows — each associated with a season — that accompany this bow can be fired only from it. Each arrow disappears immediately after it's used, and it reappears in the quiver at the next dusk. The save DC against spells cast with the arrows is 18. Each arrow has a unique property:

* **Spring.** As an action, you can fire this arrow, targeting a beast or a plant creature you can see within 320 feet of you. On a hit, the arrow deals no damage, and the target gains the benefits of the awaken spell for 8 hours.
* **Summer.** As an action, you can fire this arrow at an unoccupied space on the ground that you can see within 320 feet of you, no attack roll required. A Nyxborn lynx is summoned in that space (use the stat block for a **tiger** with the Nyxborn traits from chapter 6 of MOT). The lynx understands your verbal commands and obeys them as best it can, and it takes its turns immediately after yours. The emissary remains for 1 hour before fading away.
* **Autumn.** As an action, you can fire this arrow at a space on the ground that you can see within 320 feet of you, no attack roll required, casting the [Wall of Thorns](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:wall-of-thorns) spell there.
* **Winter.** As an action, you can fire this arrow at a space that you can see within 320 feet of you, no attack roll required, casting the [Ice Storm](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:ice-storm) spell there.

***Destroying the Bow.*** The bow can't be destroyed without first destroying all its arrows. The winter arrow must be fed to a cerberus on the winter solstice. The spring arrow must be planted at the base of a Black Oak of Asphodel on the spring equinox. The summer arrow must be broken by a sea giant on the summer solstice. Then the autumn arrow must be shot into the carcass of a hydra on the autumnal equinox. When all four arrows are destroyed, the bow and quiver dissolve into dust.

## Eye and Hand of Vecna
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)*

Seldom is the name of Vecna spoken except in a hushed voice. Vecna was, in his time, one of the mightiest of all wizards. Through dark magic and conquest, he forged a terrible empire. For all his power, Vecna couldn't escape his own mortality. He began to fear death and take steps to prevent his end from ever coming about.

Orcus, the demon prince of undeath, taught Vecna a ritual that would allow him to live on as a lich. Beyond death, he became the greatest of all liches. Even though his body gradually withered and decayed, Vecna continued to expand his evil dominion. So formidable and hideous was his temper that his subjects feared to speak his name. He was the Whispered One, the Master of the Spider Throne, the Undying King, and the Lord of the Rotted Tower.

Some say that Vecna's lieutenant Kas coveted the Spider Throne for himself, or that the sword his lord made for him seduced him into rebellion. Whatever the reason, Kas brought the Undying King's rule to an end in a terrible battle that left Vecna's tower a heap of ash. Of Vecna, all that remained were one hand and one eye, grisly artifacts that still seek to work the Whispered One's will in the world.

The *Eye of Vecna* and the *Hand of Vecna* might be found together or separately. The eye looks like a bloodshot organ torn free from the socket. The hand is a mummified and shriveled left extremity.

To attune to the eye, you must gouge out your own eye and press the artifact into the empty socket. The eye grafts itself to your head and remains there until you die. Once in place, the eye transforms into a golden eye with a slit for a pupil, much like that of a cat. If the eye is ever removed, you die.

To attune to the hand, you must lop off your left hand at the wrist and the press the artifact against the stump. The hand grafts itself to your arm and becomes a functioning appendage. If the hand is ever removed, you die.

***Random Properties.*** The *Eye of Vecna* and the *Hand of Vecna* each have the following random properties:

* 1 minor beneficial property
* 1 major beneficial property
* 1 minor detrimental property

***Properties of the Eye.*** Your alignment changes to neutral evil, and you gain the following benefits:

* You have truesight.
* You can use an action to see as if you were wearing a [Ring of X-Ray Vision](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:ring-of-x-ray-vision). You can end this effect as a bonus action.
* The eye has 8 charges. You can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: [Clairvoyance](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:clairvoyance) (2 charges), [Crown of Madness](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:crown-of-madness) (1 charge), [Disintegrate](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:disintegrate) (4 charges), [Dominate Monster](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:dominate-monster) (5 charges), or [Eyebite](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:eyebite) (4 charges). The eye regains 1d4 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. Each time you cast a spell from the eye, there is a 5 percent chance that Vecna tears your soul from your body, devours it, and then takes control of the body like a puppet. If that happens, you become an NPC under the DM's control.

***Properties of the Hand.*** Your alignment changes to neutral evil, and you gain the following benefits:

* Your Strength score becomes 20, unless it is already 20 or higher.
* Any melee spell attack you make with the hand, and any melee weapon attack made with a weapon held by it, deals an extra 2d8 cold damage on a hit.
* The hand has 8 charges. You can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: [Finger of Death](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:finger-of-death) (5 charges), [Sleep](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:sleep) (1 charge), [Slow](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:slow) (2 charges), or [Teleport](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:teleport) (3 charges). The hand regains 1d4 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. Each time you cast a spell from the hand, it casts the [Suggestion](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:suggestion) spell on you (save DC 18), demanding that you commit an evil act. The hand might have a specific act in mind or leave it up to you.

***Properties of the Eye and Hand.*** If you are attuned to both the hand and eye, you gain the following additional benefits:

* You are immune to disease and poison.
* Using the eye's X-ray vision never causes you to suffer exhaustion.
* You experience premonitions of danger and, unless you are incapacitated, can't be surprised.
* If you start your turn with at least 1 hit point, you regain 1d10 hit points.
* If a creature has a skeleton, you can attempt to turn its bones to jelly with a touch of the *Hand of Vecna*. You can do so by using an action to make a melee attack against a creature you can reach, using your choice of your melee attack bonus for weapons or spells. On a hit, the target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or drop to 0 hit points.
* You can use an action to cast [Wish](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:wish). This property can't be used again until 30 days have passed.

***Destroying the Eye and Hand.*** If the *Eye of Vecna* and the *Hand of Vecna* are both attached to the same creature, and that creature is slain by the Sword of Kas, both the eye and the hand burst into flame, turn to ash, and are destroyed forever. Any other attempt to destroy the eye or hand seems to work, but the artifact reappears in one of Vecna's many hidden vaults, where it waits to be rediscovered.

*Weapon (warhammer), artifact (requires attunement)*

Crafted from a single piece of obsidian, this warhammer of Torog hums with magical energy and is carved with the images of faces screaming in pain.

***Sentience.*** *Grovelthrash* is a sentient neutral evil weapon with an Intelligence of 18, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 19. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Abyssal, Common, and Infernal.

***Personality.*** A covetous ultroloth named Ciria lives within *Grovelthrash*. The weapon values material possessions and doling out pain. It compliments its wielder whenever they claim treasure and takes pleasure in harming others.

***Dormant.*** The warhammer grants the following benefits in its dormant state:

* You can speak, read, and write Abyssal and Infernal.
* You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit with an attack using this warhammer, you can deal an extra 2d6 bludgeoning damage to the target. If you do, you take 1d6 psychic damage. The warhammer deals double damage to objects and structures.

## Helm of Perfect Potential
Source: Bigby Presents - Glory of the Giants

*Wondrous Item, Artifact (Requires Attunement)*

This copper-hued helm contains a shard of the Elemental Chaos embedded in its forehead, surrounded by a motif of a rising sun. Legend says Annam fashioned this helm for his daughter Diancastra to hold the fragment of chaos she used to prove her worth to her father.

**Random Properties.** The helm has the following random properties, determined by rolling on the appropriate table in the *Dungeon Master’s Guide*:

* 2 minor beneficial properties

## Iggwilv's Cauldron
Source: The Wild Beyond The Witchlight

*Wondrous Item, Artifact (Requires Attunement by a Spellcaster)*

Iggwilv crafted this wondrous cauldron with the help of her adoptive mother, the archfey Baba Yaga. The cauldron has two forms. Only Iggwilv or Baba Yaga can change the cauldron from one form to another (by using an action to touch it), which either can do without being attuned to the item. In its first form, the cauldron is made of solid gold and embossed on the outside with images of bare-branched trees, falling leaves, and broomsticks. In its second form, the cauldron is made of iron and embossed on the outside with images of bats, toads, cats, lizards, and snakes—eight of each animal. In either form, the cauldron is roughly 3 feet in diameter and has a 2-foot-wide mouth, a round lid with a molded handle at the top, and eight clawed feet for stability. The cauldron weighs 80 pounds when empty, and it can hold up to 100 gallons of liquid.

**Attunement.** Any Humanoid creature that attunes to the cauldron must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be aged to the point of decrepitude. In this state, the creature's speed is halved, the range of its vision and hearing is reduced to 30 feet, and it has disadvantage on all ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws. The creature will reach the end of its natural life span in 3d8 days. Only a [Wish](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:wish) spell or divine intervention can reverse this aging effect on the creature.

Three hags can attune to the cauldron simultaneously, provided they have formed a coven. If the coven disbands, the attunement ends for all three hags.

**Random Properties.** Regardless of the form it takes, the cauldron has the following random properties:

* 1 minor beneficial property (determined by rolling on the Minor Beneficial Properties table in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*)
* 1 minor detrimental property (determined by rolling on the Minor Detrimental Properties table in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*)

**Gold Cauldron.** The gold cauldron has the following properties:

* If water is poured into the cauldron and stirred for 1 minute, it transforms into a hearty, hot stew that provides one nourishing meal for up to four people per gallon of water used. The stew remains hot while in the cauldron, then cools naturally after it is removed. The outside of the cauldron remains safe to touch despite the heat of the stew.
* If wine is poured into the cauldron and stirred for 10 minutes, it transforms into a magical elixir that fortifies up to four people per gallon of wine used. Any creature that imbibes the elixir gains 10 temporary hit points. Any of the elixir that isn't consumed within 1 hour vanishes. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again until the next dawn.
* When the cauldron is filled with 90 gallons of water mixed with 10 gallons of wine, it can be used as the focus for a [Scrying](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:scrying) spell. When this spell is cast using the cauldron as its focus, the target of the spell fails its saving throw automatically, and the spell works even if its caster and the target are on different planes of existence. When the spell ends, all the liquid in the cauldron vanishes.
* Dipping the bristles of an ordinary broom into the water-filled cauldron transforms the broom into a [Broom of Flying](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:broom-of-flying) for 3 days. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again until the next dawn.

**Iron Cauldron.** The iron cauldron has the following properties:

* You can use an action to scream into the empty cauldron, which magically summons a **swarm of bats** that flies out of the cauldron and acts immediately after you in the initiative order. The swarm obeys your commands and disappears after 1 minute if it hasn't been destroyed by then. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again until the next dawn.
* If at least 1 gallon of blood is poured into the cauldron and stirred for 1 minute, it turns into a cloud of harmless black smoke that erupts from the cauldron and dissipates quickly. At the same time, all Humanoid creatures within a certain radius of the cauldron fall unconscious for 1 hour, except those that are attuned to the cauldron or immune to being charmed. The radius of the effect is 100 feet per gallon of blood used. An unconscious creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an action to shake or slap it. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again until the next dawn.
* Tying a dead frog or toad to the end of an ordinary branch and dipping it in the water-filled cauldron transforms the branch into a [Wand of Polymorph](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:wand-of-polymorph) with 3 charges. This wand can't recharge and crumbles to ashes when its final charge is expended. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again for 8 days.
* If you spend 1 minute touching the cauldron with a unicorn's horn while reciting the poem called "The Witch Queen's Cauldron", all creatures within 1,000 feet of the cauldron except those that are attuned to it become frozen in time. A time-frozen creature is incapacitated, can't move or speak, doesn't age, and is unaware of its surroundings or the passage of time. Moreover, it can't be moved, harmed in any way, or affected by any other magic. All other conditions and effects on the creature are suppressed until it is no longer frozen in time. Destroying the cauldron, sending it to another plane of existence, or touching it with a unicorn's horn for 1 minute while reciting "The Witch Queen's Cauldron" ends the time-freezing effect on all creatures. The effect also ends on any creature that comes into contact with an antimagic field or is touched by a unicorn's horn.

**Destroying the Cauldron.** The cauldron is a Medium object with AC 19, 80 hit points, and immunity to damage from any source other than a [Flame Tongue](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:flame-tongue) or [Frost Brand](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:frost-brand) weapon. Reducing the cauldron to 0 hit points with such a weapon shatters the cauldron into eight pieces of roughly equal size, whereupon all ongoing effects created by the cauldron end as it loses its magic.

The destruction of *Iggwilv's Cauldron* causes all hags in the multiverse to lose the Shared Spellcasting trait gained by being in a coven (see the "Hag Covens" sidebar in the *Monster Manual*).

**Reconstructing the Cauldron.** If all eight pieces of the shattered cauldron are within 5 feet of one another, a [Wish](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:wish) spell can reassemble them, restoring the cauldron and all its properties. The cauldron's reconstruction also restores the Shared Spellcasting trait of hag covens throughout the multiverse.

## Khrusor, Spear of Heliod
Source: Mythic Odysseys of Theros

*Weapon (spear), artifact (requires attunement)*

Heliod wields *Khrusor*, a spear blessed with the power of the sun. In his hands, it can be pitched from Nyx to any point on Theros. When Heliod lends his weapon to a mortal, it's typically so they can perform some great work in his name or as a test of their worthiness.

***Spear of the Sun.*** This spear grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. When you hit with an attack using this spear, the target takes an extra 2d8 radiant damage.

***Blessing of the Sun.*** If you are a worshiper of Heliod, you gain all the following benefits for which you have the required piety:

* **Piety 3+.** You gain 15 temporary hit points each dawn.
* **Piety 10+.** The spear has 1 randomly determined minor beneficial property.
* **Piety 25+.** The spear has 1 additional randomly determined minor beneficial property.
* **Piety 50+.** The spear has 1 randomly determined major beneficial property.

If you aren't a worshiper of Heliod, the spear has 2 randomly determined major detrimental properties.

See "Artifacts" in chapter 7 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide* for details on randomly determined properties.

***Luminous.*** The spear sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The light is sunlight.

***Sun's Retaliation.*** When you take damage from a creature within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee attack with the spear against that creature. On a hit, the spear deals damage as normal, and the creature is blinded until the start of its next turn. This property of the spear can't be used again until the next dawn.

***Spells.*** The spear has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: [Guiding Bolt](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:guiding-bolt) (1 charge), [Daylight](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:daylight) (3 charges, targeting the tip of the spear only), [Sunbeam](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:sunbeam) (6 charges). The spear regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn.

***Destroying the Spear.*** If taken to Erebos's palace in Tizerus, and used to sacrifice a champion of Heliod to Erebos, *Khrusor* is either destroyed or fundamentally twisted to Erebos's service.

## Lash of Shadows
Source: Explorer's Guide to Wildemount

*Weapon (whip), artifact (requires attunement)*

This snakeskin whip is touched by the power of Zehir and ends in five animated serpent heads.

***Sentience.*** The *Lash of Shadows* is a sentient chaotic evil weapon with an Intelligence of 18, a Wisdom of 16, and a Charisma of 20. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Abyssal, Common, and Draconic.

***Personality.*** A mad marilith named Sizlifeth lives within the *Lash of Shadows*. The weapon has a short temper and experiences only extreme emotions. It is most happy when dealing harm.

***Dormant.*** The whip grants the following benefits in its dormant state:

* You can speak, read, and write Abyssal and Draconic.
* You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
* You can attempt to poison any creature that is hit by the whip. The creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer the effect of one of the following poisons of your choice; once a poison other than Serpent Venom has been used, that poison can't be used again until the next dawn:
  * **Dead Eyes.** A creature that fails the saving throw against this poison is poisoned for 1 hour. While poisoned in this way, the creature is blinded.
  * **Serpent Venom.** A creature that fails the saving throw against this poison takes 3d6 poison damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.

***Awakened.*** When the whip reaches an awakened state, it gains the following properties:

* The weapon's bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +2.
* The saving throw DC for the weapon's poisons increases to 15.
* The weapon gains a new poison option called **Ghoul's Blood**. A creature that fails the saving throw against this poison is poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned in this way, the creature is paralyzed. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Exalted.*** When the whip reaches an exalted state, it gains the following additional properties:

* The weapon's bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +3.
* The saving throw DC for the weapon's poisons increases to 17.
* The weapon gains a new poison option called **Cockatrice Tears**. A creature that fails the saving throw against this poison begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified for 24 hours.

## Luba's Tarokka of Souls
Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything

*Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)*

Not all lingering spirits are tragic souls, lost on their way to the hereafter. Some languish as prisoners, souls so wicked mortals dare not free them upon an unsuspecting afterlife.

Created by a figure of Vistani legend, *Luba's Tarokka of Souls* shaped the destiny of countless heroes. The prophecies of this deck of cards also revealed great evils and guided its creator into the path of nefarious forces. Untold times the deck's creator, Mother Luba, narrowly escaped doom, spared only by her keen insights. But even for her not all wickedness could be escaped. In the most dire cases, Mother Luba managed to ensnare beings of pure evil amid the strands of fate, imprisoning them within her tarroka deck. There these foul spirits dwell still, trapped within a nether-realm hidden amid shuffling cards, waiting for fate to turn foul — as it inevitably will.

Like all tarokka decks, the *Tarokka of Souls* is a lavishly illustrated collection of fifty-four cards, comprising the fourteen cards of the high deck and forty other cards divided into four suits: coins, glyphs, stars, and swords.

***Random Properties.*** The artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the "Artifacts" section of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*:

* 2 minor detrimental properties
* 2 minor beneficial properties

***Spells.*** While holding the deck, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: [Comprehend Languages](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:comprehend-languages), [Detect Evil and Good](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:detect-evil-and-good), [Detect Magic](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:detect-magic), [Detect Poison and Disease](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:detect-poison-and-disease), [Locate Object](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:locate-object), or [Scrying](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:scrying). Once you use the deck to cast a spell, you can't cast that spell again from it until the next dawn.

***Enduring Vision.*** While holding the deck, you automatically succeed on Constitution saving throws made to maintain your concentration on divination spells.

***Twist of Fate.*** As an action, you can draw a card from the deck and twist the fortune of another creature you can see within 15 feet of you. Choose one of the following effects:

* ***Weal.*** The creature has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws for the next hour.
* ***Woe.*** The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws for the next hour.

The deck can be used in this way twice, and you regain all expended uses at the next dawn.

***Prisoners of Fate.*** Whenever you use the Twist of Fate property, there is a chance that one of the souls trapped in the deck escapes. Roll d100 and consult the Souls of the Tarokka table. If you roll one of the high cards, the soul associated with it escapes. You can find its statistics in the *Monster Manual*. If you roll a soul that has already escaped, roll again.

|Souls of the Tarokka|           |             |
|--------------------|-----------|-------------|
|        d100        |   Card    |    Soul     |

|         6          |Executioner|Death knight |
|         7          |   Ghost   |    Ghost    |
|         8          | Horseman  | Mummy lord  |
|         9          | Innocent  |    Ghost    |
|         10         |Marionette |    Mummy    |
|         11         |   Mists   |   Wraith    |
|         12         |   Raven   |Vampire spawn|
|         13         |   Seer    |   Vampire   |
|         14         |  Tempter  |Vampire spawn|
|       15-00        |     —     |      —      |

The released soul appears at a random location within 10d10 miles of you and terrorizes the living. Until the released soul is destroyed, it gains the benefit of a weal from the deck's Twist of Fate property, and both you and the original target of Twist of Fate suffer the effect of woe.

***Shuffling Fate.*** If you go 7 days without using the Twist of Fate property, your attunement to *Luba's Tarroka of Souls* ends, and you can't attune to it again until after another creature uses Twist of Fate on you.

***Destroying the Deck.*** *Luba's Tarokka of Souls* can be destroyed only if all fourteen souls within are released and destroyed. This reveals a fifteenth soul, a **lich**, that inhabits the Nether card, which appears only when the fourteen souls are defeated. If this ancient entity is destroyed, the Nether card vanishes and the deck becomes a normal tarokka deck, with no special properties, but it includes a new card of the DM's design.

## Mace of the Black Crown
Source: Explorer's Guide to Wildemount

*Weapon (mace), artifact (requires attunement)*

This mace has a haft of black iron and a ruby head with a fiendish countenance. Carrying the boon of Asmodeus, it is fit for the most powerful servants of the Nine Hells.

***Sentience.*** The *Mace of the Black Crown* is a sentient lawful evil weapon with an Intelligence of 20, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common and Infernal.

***Personality.*** A greedy erinyes named Xartaza lives within the *Mace of the Black Crown*. Xartaza wants to recruit more souls for Asmodeus, so the weapon pushes its wielder toward lawful evil actions by manipulating the wielder's dreams. A former Blood War general, Xartaza hates demons and relishes crafting sound battle plans in any conflict.

***Dormant.*** The mace grants the following benefits in its dormant state:

* You can speak, read, and write Infernal.
* You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
* While holding the mace, you can use a bonus action to speak its Infernal command word, causing flames to erupt from the head. These flames shed bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. While the mace is ablaze, it deals an extra 1d6 fire damage to any target it hits. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you are no longer holding the mace.
* While holding the mace, you can use an action to summon an **imp**. Any devil you summon with this mace is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. The imp obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it and returns to the Nine Hells 10 minutes after you summoned it. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.

***Awakened.*** When the mace reaches an awakened state, it gains the following properties:

* The weapon's bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +2, and the extra fire damage dealt by the weapon when it is ignited increases to 2d6.
* The weapon's Summon Devil feature can also be used to summon a **bearded devil**.
* You have resistance to poison damage while holding this weapon.

***Exalted.*** When the mace reaches an exalted state, it gains the following properties:

* The weapon's bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +3, and the extra fire damage dealt by the weapon when it is ignited increases to 3d6. Fire damage dealt by the mace ignores resistance to fire damage.
* The weapon's Summon Devil feature can also be used to summon a **barbed devil**.
* You have resistance to fire damage while you hold this weapon.

## Mastix, Whip of Erebos
Source: Mythic Odysseys of Theros

*Weapon (whip), artifact (requires attunement)*

Erebos wields *Mastix*, a whip capable of extending like an impossibly long shadow. In the hands of the god of the dead, the whip snares the reluctant dead and drags them into his realm. When Erebos grants his weapon to a mortal follower, it's typically to reclaim a powerful soul or to humiliate Heliod.

***Whip of the Dead.*** Erebos's whip seethes with the enervating energy of the Underworld. This magic whip grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. When you hit with an attack using this whip, the target takes an extra 2d8 necrotic damage and you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt.

Additionally, when you make an attack with the whip on your turn, you can increase the range of the attack to 300 feet. This property of the weapon can't be used again until the next dusk.

***Blessing of the Dead.*** If you are a worshiper of Erebos, you gain all the following benefits for which you have the required piety:

* **Piety 1+.** The whip has 1 randomly determined minor detrimental property-a burden Erebos imposes to test his faithful.
* **Piety 25+.** The whip has 1 randomly determined major beneficial property.
* **Piety 50+.** The whip has 1 additional randomly determined major beneficial property.

If you aren't a worshiper of Erebos, the whip has 2 randomly determined major detrimental properties.

See "Artifacts" in chapter 7 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide* for details on randomly determined properties.

***Erebos's Claim.*** While carrying the whip, you can use an action to cast either [Circle of Death](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:circle-of-death) or [Dominate Monster](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:dominate-monster) (targeting only undead) from the whip. The save DC for these spells is 18. Once you use the whip to cast a spell, that spell can't be cast from it again until the next dusk.

***Destroying the Whip.*** To destroy the whip, it must be taken to the heights of Mount Hiastos in Nyx, unraveled by a Returned, and left to bask in continual daylight for one month.

## Mighty Servant of Leuk-o
Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything

*Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)*

Named for the warlord who infamously employed it, the *Mighty Servant of Leuk-o* is a fantastically powerful, 10-foot-tall machine that turns into an animate construct when piloted. Crafted of a gleaming black alloy of unknown origin, the servant is often described as a combination of a disproportioned dwarf and an oversized beetle. The servant contains enough space for 1 ton of cargo and a crew compartment within, from which up to two Medium creatures can control it — and potentially execute a spree of unstoppable destruction.

Tales of the servant's origins involve more conjecture than fact, often referring to otherworldly beings, the mysterious Barrier Peaks in Oerth, and the supposedly related device known as the [Machine of Lum the Mad](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:the-infernal-machine-of-lum-the-mad). The best details on the device's origins and operation can be found in the *Mind of Metal*, a tome of artificer's secrets that connects the device to the traditions of the lost Olman people, and which was written by Lum the Mad's several times over granddaughter, Lum the Maestro, while she reconstructed the long disassembled *Mighty Servant of Leuk-o*.

***Dangerous Attunement.*** Two creatures can be attuned to the servant at a time. If a third creature tries to attune to it, nothing happens.

The servant's controls are accessed by a hatch in its upper back, which is easily opened while there are no creatures attuned to the artifact.

Attuning to the artifact requires two hours, which can be undertaken as part of a long rest, during which time you must be inside the servant, interacting with its controls. While crew members are attuning themselves, any creature or structure outside and within 50 feet of the servant has a 25 percent chance of being accidentally targeted by one of its Destructive Fist attacks once during the attunement. This process must be undergone every time a creature attunes itself to the artifact.

***Controlling the Servant.*** While any creatures are attuned to the artifact, attuned creatures can open the hatch as easily as any other door. Other creatures can open the hatch as an action with a successful DC 25 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. A [Knock](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:knock) spell cast on the hatch also opens it until the start of the caster's next turn.

A creature can enter or exit through the hatch by spending 10 feet of movement. Those inside the servant have total cover from effects originating outside it. The controls within it allow creatures to see outside without obstruction.

While you are inside the servant, you can command it by using the controls. During your turn (for either attuned creature), you can command it in the following ways:

* Open or close the hatch (no action required, once per turn)
* Move the servant up to its speed (no action required)
* As an action, you can command the servant to take one of the actions in its stat block or some other action.
* When a creature provokes an opportunity attack from the servant, you can use your reaction to command the servant to make one Destructive Fist attack against that creature.

While there are no attuned creatures inside the servant, it is an inert object.

***Ghost in the Machine.*** Upon his death, the soul of the mighty warlord Leuk-o was drawn into the artifact and has become its animating force. The servant has been known to attack or move of its own accord, particularly if doing so will cause destruction. Once every 24 hours, the servant, at the DM's discretion, takes one action while uncrewed.

If the servant loses half of its hit points or more, each creature attuned to it must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for 24 hours. While charmed in this way, the creature goes on a destructive spree, seeking to destroy structures and attack any unattuned creatures within sight of the servant, starting with those threatening the artifact — preferably using the servant, if possible.

***Self-Destruct.*** By inputting a specific series of lever pulls and button presses, the servant's two crew members can cause it to explode. The self-destruct code is not revealed to crew members when they attune to the artifact. If the code is discovered (the DM determines how), it requires two attuned crew members to be inside the servant and spend their actions on 3 consecutive rounds performing the command. Should the crew members begin the process of entering the code, though, the servant uses its Ghost in the Machine property and turns the crew members against each other.

If the crew members successfully implement the code, at the end of the third round, the servant explodes. Every creature in a 100 foot-radius sphere centered on the servant must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 87 (25d6) force damage, 87 (25d6) lightning damage, and 87 (25d6) thunder damage. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. Objects and structures in the area take triple damage. Creatures inside the servant are slain instantly and leave behind no remains.

This does not destroy the servant permanently. Rather, 2d6 days later, its parts — left arm, left leg, right arm, right leg, lower torso, and upper torso — drop from the sky in random places within 1,000 miles of the explosion. If brought within 5 feet of one another, the pieces reconnect and reform the servant.

***Destroying the Servant.*** The servant can be destroyed in two ways. After it has self-destructed, its disconnected pieces can be melted down in one of the forge-temples of its ancient Olman creators. Alternatively, if the servant strikes the [Machine of Lum the Mad](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:the-infernal-machine-of-lum-the-mad), both artifacts explode in an eruption that is three times the size and three times the damage as the servant's Self-Destruct property.

## Orb of Dragonkind
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)*

Ages past, on the world of Krynn, elves and humans waged a terrible war against evil dragons. When the world seemed doomed, the wizards of the Towers of High Sorcery came together and worked their greatest magic, forging five *Orbs of Dragonkind* (or *Dragon Orbs*) to help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.

As the Towers of High Sorcery fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over dragons.

Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb.

An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.

While attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb's depths and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become charmed by the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it.

While you are charmed by the orb, you can't voluntarily end your attunement to it, and the orb casts [Suggestion](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:suggestion) on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Takhisis (Tiamat's name on Krynn), or something else the DM decides.

***Random Properties.*** An *Orb of Dragon* kind has the following random properties:

* 2 minor beneficial properties
* 1 minor detrimental property
* 1 major detrimental property

***Spells.*** The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: [Cure Wounds](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:cure-wounds) (5th-level version, 3 charges), [Daylight](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:daylight) (1 charge), [Death Ward](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:death-ward) (2 charges), or [Scrying](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:scrying) (3 charges).

You can also use an action to cast the [Detect Magic](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:detect-magic) spell from the orb without using any charges.

***Call Dragons.*** While you control the orb, you can use an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can't be used again for 1 hour.

***Destroying an Orb.*** An *Orb of Dragonkind* appears fragile but is impervious to most damage, including the attacks and breath weapons of dragons. A disintegrate spell or one good hit from a +3 magic weapon is sufficient to destroy an orb, however.

## Orrery Of The Wanderer
Source: Acquisitions Incorporated

*Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)*

This delicate and exquisitely crafted clockwork orrery features multiple geared components whose sweeping hands and dials represent the complex interplay of planar and magical realms. Standing two feet high, the orrery housing is a wondrous device imbued with magic of its own, but the power of its six clockwork components makes the artifact even more potent.

The *Orrery of the Wanderer* was created by a renowned clockwork mage known only as Lottie. She crafted the relic as a means of tapping into the power of the planes, and to channel the divination and foretelling powers of the stars. But Lottie soon realized that her creation was far more powerful than she had intended. As it tapped into planar magic, the orrery began to manifest the darkness and malevolence inherent to some of the planes. Eventually, it would impress upon its owner a desire to open portals into the most cursed and dangerous worlds, including the Far Realm.

To prevent the orrery from ever being so used, Lottie scattered the components that powered it, secreting them across the world. But the orrery's instinct for survival is strong, and its components have a way of inexorably coming together over decades or centuries, found by treasure hunters, stolen by monsters, found and stolen again - and moving closer to each other all the time.

***Random Properties.*** The orrery has the following randomly determined properties:

* 2 minor beneficial properties
* 1 major beneficial property
* 1 major detrimental property

The random properties of the orrery might function only when all its components are installed, or might function sporadically if any components are missing.

***The Sum of Its Parts.*** Each of the six components that powers the Orrery of the Wanderer is a powerful magic relic in its own right:

* [The Chronolometer](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:chronolometer)
* [The Dimensional Loop](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:dimensional-loop)
* [The Far Gear](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:far-gear)
* [The Rotor of Return](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:rotor-of-return)
* [The Timepiece of Travel](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:timepiece-of-travel)
* [The Wheel of Stars](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:wheel-of-stars)

Creatures can attune to the orrery's components individually. If attuned to an individual component, a creature must hold the component to make use of its features. A creature can also attune to the orrery and all the components installed in it. Attuning to an installed component doesn't count against the number of magic items you can normally attune to.

While a component is not installed in the orrery, its magic might function sporadically or with unpredictable side effects, as determined by the DM.

***Future Echoes.*** With or without its components, the orrery lets you catch momentary glimpses of the future that warn you of danger. As long as the orrery is within 30 feet of you, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

***Into the Void.*** With or without its components, the attuned orrery infuses your spirit with the tumultuous energy of the planes. Over time, your alignment changes to chaotic neutral, and you are compelled to engage with and explore the most dangerous planar realms.

***Master of Travel.*** While all six components of the Orrery of the Wanderer are installed, the artifact has 7 charges. While touching the orrery, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 17): [Contact Other Plane](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:contact-other-plane) (3 charges), [Demiplane](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:demiplane) (6 charges), [Gate](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:gate) (7 charges), [Plane Shift](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:plane-shift) (5 charges), or [Teleportation Circle](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:teleportation-circle) (3 charges). The orrery regains 1d4 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn.

## Ring of Winter
Source: Tomb of Annihilation

*Ring, artifact (requires attunement)*

The *Ring of Winter* is a golden band that resizes to fit snugly on the finger of its wearer. A thin layer of frost coats the outside of the ring, which normal heat can't melt. The ring feels ice cold to the touch and initially numbs the hand that wears it, but this cold ceases to be felt by one who is attuned to the ring.

The *Ring of Winter* is sentient and tries to take control of any creature that wears it (see "Sentient Magic Items" in chapter 7 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*). If it succeeds, the ring compels its wearer to cause undue harm to everyone and everything around it, in a cold-hearted attempt to incur the wrath of enemies and bring about the wearer's doom.

***Sentience.*** The *Ring of Winter* is a sentient chaotic evil item with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 17. The ring communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature carrying or wielding it, and it has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 60 feet. The ring craves destruction, and it likes inflicting indiscriminate harm on others.

***Nondetection.*** The *Ring of Winter* defies attempts to magically locate it. Neither the ring nor its wearer can be targeted by any divination magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors.

***Frozen Time.*** As long as you wear the ring, you don't age naturally. This effect is similar to suspended animation, in that your age doesn't catch up to you once the ring is removed. The ring doesn't protect its wearer from magical or supernatural aging effects, such as the Horrifying Visage of a ghost.

***Cold Immunity.*** While attuned to and wearing the ring, you have immunity to cold damage and don't suffer any ill effects from extreme cold (see chapter 5 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*).

***Magic.*** The *Ring of Winter* has 12 charges and regains all its expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, you can expend the necessary number of charges to activate one of the following properties:

* You can expend 1 charge as an action and use the ring to lower the temperature in a 120-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see within 300 feet of you. The temperature in that area drops 20 degrees per minute, to a minimum of -30 degrees Fahrenheit. Frost and ice begin to form on surfaces once the temperature drops below 32 degrees. This effect is permanent unless you use the ring to end it as an action, at which point the temperature in the area returns to normal at a rate of 10 degrees per minute.
* You can cast one of the following spells from the ring (spell save DC 17) by expending the necessary number of charges: [Bigby's Hand](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:bigbys-hand) (2 charges; the hand is made of ice, is immune to cold damage, and deals bludgeoning damage instead of force damage as a clenched fist), [Cone of Cold](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:cone-of-cold) (2 charges), Flesh to Ice (3 charges; as [Flesh to Stone](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:flesh-to-stone) except that the target turns to solid ice with the density and durability of stone), [Ice Storm](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:ice-storm) (2 charges), [Otiluke's Freezing Sphere](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:otilukes-freezing-sphere) (3 charges), [Sleet Storm](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:sleet-storm) (1 charge), [Spike Growth](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:spike-growth) (1 charge; the spikes are made of ice), or [Wall of Ice](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:wall-of-ice) (2 charges).
* You can expend the necessary number of charges as an action and use the ring to create either an inanimate ice object (2 charges) or an animated ice creature (4 charges). The ice object can't have any moving parts, must be able to fit inside a 10-foot cube, and has the density and durability of metal or stone (your choice). The ice creature must be modeled after a beast with a challenge rating of 2 or less. The ice creature has the same statistics as the beast it models, with the following changes: the creature is a construct with vulnerability to fire damage, immunity to cold and poison damage, and immunity to the following conditions: charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned. The ice creature obeys only its creator's commands. The ice object or creature appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of you. It melts into a pool of normal water after 24 hours or when it drops to 0 hit points. In extreme heat, it loses 5 (1d10) hit points per minute as it melts. Use the guidelines in chapter 8 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide* to determine the hit points of an inanimate object if they become necessary.

***Other Properties.*** The *Ring of Winter* is rumored to possess other properties that can be activated only by an evil being whose will the ring can't break. Frost giants have long believed that the ring can be used to freeze entire worlds, while a djinni in the service of a Calishite pasha once claimed that the ring could be used to summon and control white dragons, as well as a mighty ice primordial named Cryonax.

***Destroying the Ring.*** The ring is nigh indestructible, resisting even the most intense magical heat. If it is placed on the finger of the powerful arch fey known as the Summer Queen, the ring melts away and is destroyed forever.

## Rod of Seven Parts
Source: Vecna - Eve of Ruin

*Rod, Artifact (Requires Attunement)*

Eons ago, a war between the primordials and the gods scarred the planes of existence. A demon lord named Miska the Wolf-Spider eventually pushed the primordials’ enemies to the brink of annihilation.  
Desperate to save themselves and their allies, powerful elemental beings called the Wind Dukes of Aaqa rose against Miska. Committed to the concept of law, the Wind Dukes descended from a people called the vaati, who once ruled many worlds. Seven Wind Dukes wove their power into an artifact called the Rod of Law. The dukes used the rod to imprison Miska on the plane of Pandemonium. As a result, the rod shattered into seven parts that were scattered throughout the multiverse. The rod thus became known as the Rod of Law.

**Possessing the Broken Rod.** The rod can’t be attuned to while it is broken. While holding one piece of the broken rod, you know the general location of the next consecutive piece, as the rod yearns to be a complete artifact. Multiple rod pieces can be assembled into one piece or disassembled again, each requiring an action, although a partially complete rod doesn’t gain any other abilities.  
Additionally, while holding one piece of the broken rod, you can use an action to cast the spell associated with that piece, as listed on the Rod Pieces table. Once that piece of the rod has been used to cast a spell, it can’t be used that way again until the next dawn.

**Possessing the Whole Rod**. Once all seven pieces are reassembled, a creature can attune to the Rod of Seven Parts. While attuned to the rod, you gain the following benefits:

**Magic Weapon.** The Rod of Seven Parts functions for you as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

**Rod Spellcasting.** The Rod of Seven Parts has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the rod, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and cast any of the spells in the Rod Pieces table. You can also use an action to cast  
[Detect Evil and Good](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:detect-evil-and-good) from the rod without using any charges.

**Ultimate Law.** If you are not of a lawful alignment, you find your worldview shifting toward keeping a personal code. You are more apt to keep your promises, follow through on your declarations, and adhere to your beliefs.

**Destroying the Rod.** The only way to destroy the Rod of Seven Parts is to immerse the assembled rod in lava in the Abyss. It must remain in the lava for fifty years before it finally is consumed.

A piece of the rod may be temporarily destroyed in this way, but each piece re-forms one year after it has succumbed. A re-formed piece teleports to a random place in the multiverse

## Ruin's Wake
Source: Explorer's Guide to Wildemount

*Weapon (spear), artifact (requires attunement)*

This spear is made from the ivory bone of an ancient gold dragon and carved with an Ore hymn to Gruumsh.

***Sentience.*** *Ruin's Wake* is a sentient chaotic evil weapon with an Intelligence of 20, a Wisdom of 16, and a Charisma of 22. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Abyssal, Common, and Orc.

***Personality.*** A slaughter-loving balor named Yarrowish lives within *Ruin's Wake*. The weapon desires only to draw blood and pushes its wielder to solve problems with violence.

***Dormant.*** The spear grants the following benefits in its dormant state:

* You can speak, read, and write Abyssal and Orc.
* You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, and it deals an extra 1d8 piercing damage to any target it hits. Immediately after you make a ranged attack with this weapon, it flies back to your hand.
* As a reaction when you are hit by a melee attack, you can make a melee attack with *Ruin's Wake* with advantage against the attacker. You can't use this property again until you finish a short or long rest.

***Awakened.*** When the spear reaches an awakened state, it gains the following properties:

* The weapon's bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +2, and the extra piercing damage dealt by the weapon increases to 2d8.
* When you hurl the spear and speak a command word, it transforms into a bolt of lightning, forming a line 5 feet wide that extends out from you to a creature you can see within 120 feet of you. Each creature in the line, excluding you, must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 8d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. *Ruin's Wake* then returns to your hand. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.

***Exalted.*** When the spear reaches an exalted state, it gains the following properties:

* The weapon's bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +3.
* While holding the spear, you can let out a battle cry as a bonus action. Each creature you choose within 30 feet of you gains advantage on attack rolls until the start of your next turn. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.
* When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with an attack from the spear, you can regain hit points equal to the damage you dealt with the attack. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Ruinstone
Source: Divine Contention

*Wondrous item, artifact*

A fiery red crystal the size of a human palm.

Once per day as a bonus action, a villain can activate the ruinstone to undo one deed they have performed. The possibilities here are broad, but in combat it’s simplest to allow them the opportunity to “rewind” one action and take it again, or to reroll a failed saving throw (if it can still take actions).

Each use of the artifact has a terrible side effect: someone known to the wielder is also erased from reality. After the villain uses the ruinstone, roll a d20: on a 5-20, one of their allies disintegrates, on an 1-4, one of the player characters disintegrates.

If a creature bound its soul to the ruinstone in the “Thalivar’s Beacon” quest, the artifact explodes when used and the creature who is bound to it disintegrates, disappearing from reality and can only be brought back with a wish spell, or similar magic.

## Silken Spite
Source: Explorer's Guide to Wildemount

*Weapon (rapier), artifact (requires attunement)*

The blade of this rapier is made of spider silk. Its onyx pommel is tipped with a ruby cut in the shape of a spider, and the blade carries the blessing of Lolth.

***Sentience.*** *Silken Spite* is a sentient chaotic evil weapon with an Intelligence of 13, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 15. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 1 20 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Abyssal, Common, Elvish, and Undercommon.

***Personality.*** A murderous yochlol named Sinnafex lives within *Silken Spite*. The weapon speaks in whispers, pushing its wielder to trust no one and to kill those who cause the slightest personal offense.

***Dormant.*** The rapier grants the following benefits in its dormant state:

* You can speak, read, and write Abyssal, Elvish, and Undercommon.
* You have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, being attuned to the rapier increases the range of your darkvision by 60 feet.
* You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
* You can use an action to cause poison to coat the rapier's blade. The poison remains for 1 minute or until an attack using this weapon hits a creature. That creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is also unconscious while poisoned in this way. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature uses its action to shake the creature awake.
* While carrying the rapier, you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. Additionally, you can't be caught in webs of any sort and can move through webs as if they were difficult terrain.

***Awakened.*** When the rapier reaches an awakened state, it gains the following properties:

* The weapon's bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +2.
* The saving throw DC for the weapon's poison increases to 15.
* While holding the rapier, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it (save DC 15): [Cloudkill](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:cloudkill), [Darkness](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:darkness), [Levitate](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:levitate), or [Web](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:web). Once a spell has been cast using the rapier, that spell can't be cast from the rapier again until the next dawn.

***Exalted.*** When the rapier reaches an exalted state, it gains the following properties:

* The weapon's bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +3.
* The saving throw DC for the weapon's poison and spells cast from the weapon increases to 17.
* Magical darkness doesn't impede your darkvision.
* While holding the weapon in dim light or darkness, you can use a bonus action to teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light or darkness. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Staff of the Forgotten One
Source: Tomb of Annihilation

*Staff, artifact (requires attunement by a sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*

This crooked staff is carved from bone and topped with the skull of a forgotten archmage whom Acererak destroyed long ago. Etched into the skull's forehead is Accrerak's rune, which is known on many worlds as a sign of death.

***Beneficial Properties.*** While the staff is on your person, you gain the following benefits:

* Your proficiency bonus to Intelligence (Arcana) and Intelligence (History) checks is doubled.
* You can't be blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, petrified, or stunned.
* Undead with a challenge rating of 2 or lower will neither threaten nor attack you unless you harm them.
* You can wield the staff as a [+3 quarterstaff](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:weapon) that deals an extra 10 (3d6) necrotic damage on a hit.

***Invoke Curse.*** The *Staff of the Forgotten One* has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and target one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (using your spell save DC) or be cursed. While cursed in this way, the target can't regain hit points and has vulnerability to necrotic damage. A [Greater Restoration](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:greater-restoration), [Remove Curse](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:remove-curse), or similar spell ends the curse on the target.

***The Forgotten One.*** The bodiless life force of a dead archmage empowers the staff and is imprisoned within it. The rune carved into the staff's skull protects Acererak from this spirit's vengeance. Each time a creature other than Acererak expends any of the staff's charges, there is a 50 percent chance that the life force tries to possess the staff wielder. The wielder must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw or be possessed, becoming an NPC under the DM's control. If the intruding life force is targeted by magic such as a [Dispel Evil and Good](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:dispel-evil-and-good) spell, it becomes trapped in the staff once more. Once it takes control of another creature, the insane spirit of the dead archmage attempts to destroy the staff.

***Destroying the Staff.*** A creature in possession of the staff can use an action to break it over one knee or a solid surface. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it. Each creature in the area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 132 (24d10) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. When the staff is destroyed, the life force of the Forgotten One is released to the afterlife. Where it goes is anyone's guess.

Casting the staff into a [Sphere of Annihilation](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:sphere-of-annihilation) destroys both the staff and the Life force trapped within it. The staff doesn't explode if destroyed in this manner, but its destruction causes the sphere to be destroyed as well.

## Stone of Golorr
Source: Waterdeep - Dragon Heist

*Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)*

The *Stone of Golorr* is a glossy, greenish-gray stone that fits in the palm of your hand. The stone is actually an aboleth named Golorr, transformed by magic into an object.

***Random Properties.*** The *Stone of Golorr* has the following properties, determined by rolling on the tables in the "Artifacts" section in chapter 7 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*:

* 1 minor beneficial property
* 1 minor detrimental property

***Legend Lore.*** The *Stone of Golorr* has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the stone, you can expend 1 of its charges to cast the [Legend Lore](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:legend-lore) spell.

By using the stone to cast [Legend Lore](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:legend-lore), you communicate directly with the aboleth, and it shares its knowledge with you. The aboleth can't lie to you, but the information it provides is often cryptic or vague.

The aboleth knows where Lord Neverember's secret vault is located. It also knows that three keys are needed to open the vault and that a gold dragon named Aurinax inhabits the vault and guards its treasures.

***Failed Memory.*** When your attunement to the *Stone of Golorr* ends, you must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you lose all memory of the stone being in your possession and all knowledge imparted by it. A [Remove Curse](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:remove-curse)spell cast on you has a 20 percent chance of restoring the lost knowledge and memories, and a [Greater Restoration](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:greater-restoration) spell does so automatically.

***Sentience.*** The *Stone of Golorr* is a sentient lawful evil magic item with an Intelligence or 18, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. It can communicate telepathically with the creature that is attuned to it, as long as that creature understands at least one language. Io addition, the aboleth learns the greatest desires of any creature that communicates telepathically with the stone.

The *Stone of Golorr* hungers for information and prefers not to remain in the clutches of any creature for too long. Whenever the stone desires a new owner, it demands to be given to another intelligent creature as quickly as possible. If its demands are ignored, it tries to take control of its owner (see "Sentient Magic Items" in chapter 7 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*).

***Personality.*** The *Stone of Golorr* has an alien intellect that is both domineering and hungry for knowledge. It thinks of itself as an ageless and immortal god.

***Destroying the Stone.*** While in stone form the aboleth isn't a creature and isn't subject to effects that target creatures. The *Stone of Golorr* is immune to all damage. Casting an [Antipathy/Sympathy](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:antipathy-sympathy) spell on the stone destroys it if the antipathy effect is selected and the spell is directed to repel aberrations. When the spell is cast in this way, the stone transforms into mucus and is destroyed. and Golorr the aboleth appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of the stone's remains. The aboleth is incensed by the stone's destruction, and it attacks all other creatures it can see.

## Sword of Kas
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Weapon (longsword), artifact (requires attunement)*

When Vecna grew in power, he appointed an evil and ruthless lieutenant, Kas the Bloody Handed, to act as his bodyguard and right hand. This despicable villain served as advisor, warlord, and assassin. His successes earned him Vecna's admiration and a reward: a sword with as dark a pedigree as the man who would wield it.

For a long time, Kas faithfully served the lich but as Kas's power grew, so did his hubris. His sword urged him to supplant Vecna, so that they could rule the lich's empire in Vecna's stead. Legend says Vecna's destruction came at Kas's hand, but Vecna also wrought his rebellious lieutenant's doom, leaving only Kas's sword behind. The world was made brighter thereby.

The *Sword of Kas* is a magic, sentient longsword that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. It scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20, and deals an extra 2d10 slashing damage to undead.

If the sword isn't bathed in blood within 1 minute of being drawn from its scabbard, its wielder must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the wielder take 3d6 psychic damage. On a failed save, the wielder is dominated by the sword, as if by the [Dominate Monster](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:dominate-monster) spell, and the sword demands that it be bathed in blood. The spell effect ends when the sword's demand is met.

**Random Properties.** The *Sword of Kas* has the following random properties:

* 1 minor beneficial property
* 1 major beneficial property
* 1 minor detrimental property
* 1 major detrimental property

**Spirit of Kas.** While the sword is on your person, you add a d10 to your initiative at the start of every combat. In addition, when you use an action to attack with the sword, you can transfer some or all of its attack bonus to your Armor Class instead. The adjusted bonuses remain effect until the start of your next turn.

**Spells.** While the sword is on your person, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: [Call Lightning](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:call-lightning), [Divine Word](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:divine-word), or [Finger of Death](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:finger-of-death). Once you use the sword to cast a spell, you can't cast that spell again from it until the next dawn.

**Sentience.** The *Sword of Kas* is a sentient chaotic evil weapon with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 13, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and darkvision out to 2 range of 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common

**Personality.** The sword's purpose is to bring ruin to Vecna. Killing Vecna's worshipers, destroying the lich's works, and foiling his machinations all help to fulfill this goal.

The *Sword of Kas* also seeks to destroy anyone corrupted by the Eye and Hand of Vecna. The sword's obsession with those artifacts eventually becomes a fixation for its wielder.

**Destroying the Sword.** A creature attuned to both the [Eye of Vecna](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:eye-and-hand-of-vecna) and the [Hand of Vecna](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:eye-and-hand-of-vecna) can use the Wish property of those combined artifacts to unmake the *Sword of Kas*. The creature must cast the [Wish](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:wish) spell and make a Charisma check contested by the Charisma check of the sword. The sword must be within 30 feet of the creature, or the spell fails. If the sword wins the contest, nothing happens, and the [Wish](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:wish) spell is wasted. If the sword loses the contest, it is destroyed.

## Sword of Zariel
Source: Baldur's Gate - Descent into Avernus

*Weapon (longsword), artifact (requires attunement by a creature the sword deems worthy)*

This longsword belonged to the angel Zariel before her fall from grace. Fashioned from celestial steel, it gives off a faint glow and hum. The weapon chooses who can attune to it and who can't. It desires a wielder who embodies bravery and heroism.

***Attunement.*** The sword allows you to attune to it immediately, without having to take a short rest. The first time you attune to the sword, you are transformed into a heavenly, idealized version of yourself, blessed with otherworldly beauty and a touch of heaven in your heart. Neither magic nor divine intervention can reverse this transformation. Your alignment becomes lawful good, and you gain the following traits:

* ***Angelic Language.*** You can speak, read. and write Celestial.
* ***Celestial Resistance.*** You have resistance to necrotic and radiant damage.
* ***Divine Presence.*** Your Charisma score becomes 20, unless it is already 20 or higher.
* ***Feathered Wings.*** You sprout a beautiful pair of feathered wings that grant you a flying speed of 90 feet and the ability to hover. If you already have a different kind of wings, these new wings replace the old ones, which fall off.
* ***Truesight.*** Your eyes become luminous pools of silver. You can see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, perceive the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic, and see into the Ethereal Plane, all within a range of 60 feet.
* ***New Personality.*** You gain new personality traits, determined by rolling once on each of the following tables. These traits override any conflicting personality trait, ideal, bond, or flaw.

***Holy Light.*** The sword sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. Fiends find the sword's light disconcerting and painful, even if they can't see it, and have disadvantage on attack rolls made within the weapon's radius of bright light.

As a bonus action, you can intensify the sword's light, causing it to shed bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet, or reduce its glow to its normal intensity.

***Random Properties.*** The sword has 2 minor beneficial properties, each determined by rolling on the Minor Beneficial Properties table in chapter 7 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*.

***Searing Radiance.*** The sword deals an extra 9 (2d8) radiant damage to any creature it hits, or 16 (3d10) radiant damage if you're wielding the weapon with two hands. An evil creature that takes this radiant damage must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn.

***Sentience.*** The Sword of Zariel is a sentient, lawful good item with an Intelligence of 10, a Wisdom of 20, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 30 feet.

The sword communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature carrying or wielding it.

***Truth Seer.*** While holding the sword, you gain advantage on all Wisdom (Insight) checks.

***Destroying the Sword.*** Zariel can destroy the sword simply by grasping it. She couldn't bring herself to do so when she was an angel, but as an archdevil she has no compunction about ridding the multiverse of the weapon. The sword is also destroyed if it's used to shatter the Companion (see "Shattering the Companion," BG:DA, page 154), unless the blade is wielded by an angel of challenge rating 15 or higher, or a good-aligned cleric or paladin of at least 10th level.

If Zariel is killed for good (that is, if she dies in the Nine Hells), the sword becomes no harder to destroy than a normal longsword.

## Teeth of Dahlver-Nar
Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything

*Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)*

The *Teeth of Dahlver-Nar* are stories given form. They are a collection of teeth, each suggestive of wildly different origins and made from various materials. The collection rests within a leather pouch, stitched with images of heroes and whimsical creatures. Where the teeth fall, they bring legends to life.

***Using the Teeth.*** While you are holding the pouch, you can use an action to draw one tooth. Roll on the Teeth of Dahlver-Nar table to determine which tooth you draw, and you can either sow the tooth or implant it (both of which are described later).

If you don't sow or implant the tooth, roll a die at the end of your turn. On an even number, the tooth vanishes, and creatures appear as if you sowed the tooth, but they are hostile to you and your allies. On an odd number, the tooth replaces one of your teeth as if you implanted it (potentially replacing another implanted tooth, see below).

Each tooth can only be used once. Track which teeth have been used. If a tooth's result is rolled after it's been used, you draw the next lowest unused tooth on the table.

***Sowing Teeth.*** To sow the tooth, you place it on the ground in an unoccupied space within your reach, or you throw it into an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you in a body of water that is at least 50 feet wide and 50 feet long. Upon doing so, the tooth burrows into the ground and vanishes, leaving no hole behind, or it vanishes into the water. The creatures noted in the Creatures Summoned column appear in an unoccupied space as close to where the tooth was sown as possible. The creatures are allies to you, speak all languages you speak, and linger for 10 minutes before disappearing, unless otherwise noted.

***Implanting Teeth.*** To implant the tooth, you place it in your mouth, whereupon one of your own teeth falls out, and the drawn tooth takes its place, resizing to fit in your mouth. Once the tooth is implanted, you gain the effect noted in the Implanted Effect column. The tooth can't be removed while you are attuned to the teeth, and you can't voluntarily end your attunement to them. If removed after your death, the tooth vanishes. You can have a maximum number of the teeth implanted at one time equal to 1 + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 2 teeth total). If you try to implant more teeth, the newly implanted tooth replaces one of the previous teeth, determined randomly. The replaced tooth vanishes, and you lose the implanted effect.

***Recovering Teeth.*** Once all the teeth have vanished, their pouch also vanishes. The pouch with all the teeth then appears in a random destination, which could be on a different world of the Material Plane.

***Destroying the Teeth.*** Each tooth must be destroyed individually by sowing it in the area where the tooth's story originated, with the intention to destroy it. When planted in this way, creatures summoned are not friendly to you and do not vanish. Some of the creatures summoned merely head off in search of home, while others act as their tales dictate. In either case, the tooth is gone forever.

## The Bloody End
Source: Explorer's Guide to Wildemount

*Weapon (morningstar), artifact (requires attunement)*

Carrying the power of Bane, this adamantine morningstar sports foot-long spikes and has a jagged blade on its pommel.

***Sentience.*** *The Bloody End* is a sentient lawful evil weapon with an Intelligence of 22, a Wisdom of 18, and a Charisma of 24. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common and Infernal.

***Personality.*** A tyrannical pit fiend named Izeelzee lives within *The Bloody End*. The weapon boisterously pushes its wielder to subjugate others and to never back down from a challenge. If the wielder doesn't demand fealty from others, the weapon is happy to demand it on their behalf.

***Dormant.*** The morningstar grants the following benefits in its dormant state:

* You can speak, read, and write Infernal.
* You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
* While holding the morningstar, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it (save DC 13): [Charm Person](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:charm-person), [Dominate Person](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:dominate-person), or [Fear](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:fear). Once a spell has been cast using the morningstar, that spell can't be cast from it again until the next dawn.
* While holding the morningstar, you have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks.

***Awakened.*** When the morningstar reaches an awakened state, it gains the following properties:

* The weapon's bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +2.
* The saving throw DC for spells cast from the morningstar increases to 15.
* When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with an attack using *The Bloody End*, you can cause the following effect: each creature of your choice within 15 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.
* When a creature hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to deal 1d6 psychic damage to the attacker.

***Exalted.*** When the morningstar reaches an exalted state, it gains the following properties:

* The weapon's bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +3.
* Add [Dominate Monster](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:dominate-monster) to the list of spells that can be cast from the morningstar.
* The saving throw DC for spells cast from the morningstar, as well as for creatures to avoid being frightened by it, increases to 17.
* When you use your reaction to deal psychic damage to a creature that hits you with a melee attack, the amount of psychic damage increases to 2d6.

## The Infernal Machine Of Lum The Mad
Source: Infernal Machine Rebuild

*Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)*

This strange device was once thought to have been built by gods long forgotten and to have survived the eons since their passing, for it is incredibly ancient and crafted by means unlike anything known today. However, its true origins derive from a planar craft that crashed in the Barrier Peaks, for the *Infernal Machine* once functioned as this craft’s central command console.

Explorers who discovered the crash site removed the command console and brought it back to civilization, not understanding its true purpose or powers. In later years, the console came into the possession of Baron Lum. By experimenting with its many controls, he was able to achieve astounding and destructive magical effects in the building of his empire, and so the artifact came to be known as the *Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad*. Yet with Lum’s eventual defeat, his great machine was destroyed.

The *Infernal Machine* is a delicate, intricate, bulky, and heavy device, weighing some 5,500 pounds. It can be operated using a control panel containing sixty levers, forty dials, twenty switches, and a number of jeweled components. These controls generate all kinds of powers and effects, as noted below.

***Silver Wire.*** The *Infernal Machine*’s great size makes it largely immobile. To make ongoing use of the machine (such as while adventuring), it can be connected to its attuned user by a silver wire, a supply of which can always be produced from the machine’s inner workings. This silver wire shares the same general nature as the silvery cord of an [Astral Projection](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:astral-projection) spell, connecting to the body of the user and trailing behind them. When so attached, the wire becomes invisible, astral, and extends to virtually infinite length.

As long as the wire remains intact, the attuned user can make full use of the *Infernal Machine*’s powers, with their effects centered around the user. If the wire is cut — something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it can cut an [Astral Projection's](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:astral-projection) silvery cord — the user suffers a sudden burst of feedback from the machine that kills them instantly.

Any effect of the *Infernal Machine* that requires concentration can be concentrated on by a remote user. The *Infernal Machine*’s effects have a spell save DC of 14 or the attuned user’s spell save DC, whichever is higher.

***Summon Monster.*** When first used by Baron Lum, the *Infernal Machine* was known for its ability to unleash terrible monsters within the world. Specific combinations of its controls can still recreate the effects of various spells of the conjuration school, as follows:

* 1/day: [Conjure Animals](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:conjure-animals), [Summon Lesser Demons](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:summon-lesser-demons)
* 1/7 days: [Conjure Minor Elementals](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:conjure-minor-elementals), [Conjure Woodland Being](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:conjure-woodland-being), [Summon Greater Demon](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:summon-greater-demon)
* 1/month: [Conjure Elemental](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:conjure-elemental), [Conjure Fey](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:conjure-fey)

***Wish.*** The *Infernal Machine* has the ability to bend the nature of reality, with the proper combination of controls recreating the effect of a [Wish](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:wish) spell (including all side effects). Due to the complex nature of its programming, this feature can be used only once per month.  
Each time this effect is used, there is a cumulative 10 percent chance of the *Infernal Machine* malfunctioning, necessitating seven days’ worth of repairs and reprogramming, as well as the expenditure of 500 gp in parts, before it can be used again. When these repairs are done, the cumulative chance of malfunction returns to 10 percent.

***Random Properties.*** There are far more possible combinations for the *Infernal Machine*’s controls than can ever be known or matrixed — especially as the controls shift position and reset themselves over time. At the end of each long rest of the user attuned to it, the *Infernal Machine* generates 1d4 + 1 random beneficial properties and 1d4 + 1 detrimental properties. Roll for each of these properties on the Infernal Machine Properties table. To keep things interesting, the DM might roll secretly for detrimental properties, revealing those properties only during the course of play.

Once set, these properties last until the end of the attuned user’s next long rest.

(Our thanks to the D&D community for their suggestions for the properties of the *Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad*!)

***Destroying the Machine.*** The *Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad* is self-repairing of anything short of catastrophic damage, and how it was disabled in Lum’s time remains a mystery. It is rumored that if one specific combination of controls is set, the *Infernal Machine* will enter a repair mode, allowing unfettered access to its inner workings — and preventing it from restoring itself if it is attacked. Alternatively, other combinations of controls might cause the *Infernal Machine* to teleport its most critical components to some hiding place deep in space and time, rendering it inoperable until those components are found again.

## Wand of Orcus
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wand, artifact (requires attunement)*

The ghastly *Wand of Orcus* rarely leaves Orcus's side. The device, as evil as its creator, shares the demon lord's aims to snuff out the lives of all living things and bind the Material Plane in the stasis of undeath. Orcus allows the wand to slip from his grasp from time to time. When it does, it magically appears wherever its master senses an opportunity to achieve some fell goal.

Made from bones as hard as iron, the wand is topped with a magically enlarged skull that once belonged to a human hero slain by Orcus. The wand can magically change in size to better conform to the grip of its user. Plants wither, drinks spoil, flesh rots, and vermin thrive in the wand's presence.

Any creature besides Orcus that tries to attune to the wand must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature takes 10d6 necrotic damage. On a failed save, the creature dies and rises as a zombie.

In the hands of one who is attuned to it, the wand can be wielded as a magic mace that grants a + 3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The wand deals an extra 2d12 necrotic damage on a hit.

**Random Properties.** The *Wand of Orcus* has the following random properties:

* 2 minor beneficial properties
* 1 major beneficial property
* 2 minor detrimental properties
* 1 major detrimental property

The detrimental properties of the *Wand of Orcus* are suppressed while the wand is attuned to Orcus himself.

**Protection.** You gain a +3 bonus to Armor Class while holding the wand.

**Spells.** The wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action and expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: [Animate Dead](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:animate-dead) (1 charge), [Blight](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:blight) (2 charges), [Circle of Death](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:circle-of-death) (3 charges), [Finger of Death](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:finger-of-death) (3 charges), [Power Word Kill](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:power-word-kill) (4 charges), or [Speak with Dead](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:speak-with-dead) (1 charge). The wand regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn.

While attuned to the wand, Orcus or a follower blessed by him can cast each of the wand's spells using 2 fewer charges (minimum of 0).

**Call Undead.** While you are holding the wand, you can use an action to conjure skeletons and zombies, calling forth as many of them as you can divide 500 hit points among, each undead having average hit points (see the *Monster Manual* for statistics). The undead magically rise up from the ground or otherwise form in unoccupied spaces within 300 feet of you and obey your commands until they are destroyed or until dawn of the next day, when they collapse into inanimate piles of bones and rotting corpses. Once you use this property of the wand, you can't use it again until the next dawn.

While attuned to the wand, Orcus can summon any kind of undead, not just skeletons and zombies. The undead don't perish or disappear at dawn the following day, remaining until Orcus dismisses them.

**Sentience.** The *Wand of Orcus* is a sentient, chaotic evil item with an Intelligence of 16, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

The wand communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Abyssal and Common.

**Personality.** The wand's purpose is to help satisfy Orcus's desire to slay everything in the multiverse. The wand is cold, cruel, nihilistic, and bereft of humor.

In order to further its master's goals, the wand feigns devotion to its current user and makes grandiose promises that it has no intention of fulfilling, such as vowing to help its user overthrow Orcus.

**Destroying the Wand.** Destroying the *Wand of Orcus* requires that it be taken to the Positive Energy Plane by the ancient hero whose skull surmounts it. For this to happen, the long-lost hero must first be restored to life - no easy task, given the fact that Orcus has imprisoned the hero's soul and keeps it hidden and well guarded.

Bathing the wand in positive energy causes it to crack and explode, but unless the above conditions are met, the wand instantly reforms on Orcus's layer of the Abyss.

## Will of the Talon
Source: Explorer's Guide to Wildemount

*Weapon (war pick), artifact (requires attunement)*

Black, blue, green, red, and white gems carved in the form of dragon heads cover this ostentatious gold war pick, marking it as a weapon channeling the power of Tiamat.

***Sentience.*** *Will of the Talon* is a sentient lawful evil weapon with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 19. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common, Draconic, and Infernal.

***Personality.*** A short-tempered bone devil named Ashtyrlon lives within *Will of the Talon*. The weapon is greedy and values strong leadership. It demands that its wielder take decisive action to keep order in high-pressure situations — and to always take a fair share of treasure in return.

***Dormant.*** The war pick grants the following benefits in its dormant state:

* You can speak, read, and write Draconic and Infernal.
* You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
* As a bonus action while holding the war pick, you can cause the following effect: each creature of your choice that is within 30 feet of you and is aware of you must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to your Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.
* While holding the war pick, you can use your action to exhale destructive energy. Pick a damage type from the Will of the Talon Breath Weapons table. Each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a DC 13 saving throw, the type of which is specified in the table. A creature takes 3d6 damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
  * When you use the war pick to unleash a breath weapon of a specific damage type, you can't choose that same damage type again until the next dawn.

|Will of the Talon Breath Weapons|                            |            |

***Awakened.*** When the war pick reaches an awakened state, it gains the following properties:

* The weapon's bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +2.
* The saving throw DC for the war pick's Breath Weapon property increases to 15, and that property deals 4d6 damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
* The saving throw DC for the war pick's Frightful Presence property increases to 15.

* The saving throw DC for the war pick's Frightful Presence property increases to 17.

## Wyrmskull Throne
Source: Storm King's Thunder

*Wondrous item, artifact*

Built by dwarven gods and entrusted to the rulers of Shanatar, an ancient dwarven empire, the *Wyrmskull Throne* was a symbol of dwarven power and pride for ages untold. The throne hovers a foot off the ground and is a massive thing made of polished obsidian with oversized feet — the impaled skulls of four ancient blue dragons. Runes glisten in the carved obsidian, winking to life with blue energy when the throne's powers are activated.

After the fall of Shanatar, the *Wyrmskull Throne* fell into the clutches of less honorable creatures. A band of adventurers wrested the throne from the aquatic elf tyrant Gantar Kraok and sold it to the storm giant Neri for a considerable fortune. Neri had the throne magically enlarged and gave it to her husband, King Hekaton, as a gift, along with one of the Ruling Scepters of Shanatar, which she had found in a wreck at the bottom of the Trackless Sea. Only a creature attuned to a Ruling Scepter and in possession of it can harness the powers of the *Wyrmskull Throne*, which has become the centerpiece of King Hekaton's throne room in the undersea citadel of Maelstrom. Fear of the throne's power has helped prevent evil giants from challenging or threatening Hekaton's leadership.

Any creature not attuned to a Ruling Scepter who sits on the throne is paralyzed and encased in a magical force field. While encased, the creature can't be touched or moved from the throne. Touching a Ruling Scepter to the force field dispels the field, though the creature remains paralyzed until it is separated from the throne.

Any creature seated on the throne can hear faint whispers in Draconic — the whisperings of the four blue dragons whose skulls adorn the throne. Although powerless, these spirits try to influence the decisions of the throne's master.

***Properties of the Throne.*** The throne has 9 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. A creature that sits on the throne while attuned to a Ruling Scepter in its possession can harness the throne's properties, which are as follows:

* The throne gains a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover and flies where the creature wills. This property doesn't expend any charges.
* Both the throne and the creature sitting on it can move through earth and stone without disturbing the material they move through. This property doesn't expend any charges.
* As an action, the creature can expend 1 charge to cast [Lightning Bolt](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:lightning-bolt) (spell save DC 19) from the throne. The spell is cast as though using a 9th-level spell slot and deals 49 (14d6) lightning damage. The bolt discharges from the mouth of one of the throne's blue dragon skulls.
* As an action, the creature can expend 2 charges to cast the [Globe of Invulnerability](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:globe-of-invulnerability) spell from the throne. The globe encloses both the creature and the throne.
* As an action, the creature can expend 3 charges to create a spectral image of an ancient blue dragon that surrounds both it and the throne. The spectral dragon lasts for 1 minute. At the end of each of the creature's turns, the spectral dragon makes one bite attack and two claw attacks against targets of the creature's choice. These attacks have the same attack bonus, reach, and damage as an ancient blue dragon's bite and claw attacks.

***Destroying the Throne.*** The *Wyrmskull Throne* can be destroyed by breaking at least five Ruling Scepters of Shanatar simultaneously on it. This fact has never been recorded or sung of among the dwarves or any bards or storytellers, and it can't be discovered with an ability check. Characters who want to destroy the throne must go on a quest to learn the method for doing so. The throne's destruction triggers an explosion, as shards of obsidian fly out in all directions. Each creature and object within a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the throne must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 70 (20d6) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
