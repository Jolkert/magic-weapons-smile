Weapon (Attuned)
Source: Curse of Strahd

*Weapon (shortsword), unknown rarity (requires attunement)*

This sword is a sentient lawful good +1 shortsword (Intelligence 11, Wisdom 13, Charisma 13). It has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 120 feet. It communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature carrying or wielding it.

The sword’s purpose is to fight evil. The sword has the following additional properties:

The sword continually sheds bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. Only by destroying the sword can this light be extinguished.  
A lawful good creature can attune itself to the sword in 1 minute.  
While attuned to the weapon, the sword’s wielder can use the sword to cast the [Crusader's Mantle](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:crusaders-mantle) spell. Once used, this property of the sword can’t be used again until the next dawn.

## Orcus Figurine
Wondrous Item
Source: Candlekeep Mysteries

*Wondrous item, ???*

Carved from an ogre's petrified heart, the gray figurine depicts the Demon Prince of Undeath in ghastly detail, clutching his skull-topped wand in one hand and three severed heads by the hair in the other. The figurine smells like decaying flesh, and this scent is detectable out to a range of 5 feet.

The figurine is a Tiny object with AC 17, 3 hit points, and immunity to all types of damage except radiant damage. A [Detect Evil and Good](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:detect-evil-and-good) spell or similar magic reveals that the figurine has been desecrated. As long as it has at least 1 hit point, the figurine has the following magical properties:

* Undead within 30 feet of the figurine can't be turned.

* Dead creatures within 30 feet of the figurine can't be brought back to life.

* A creature that holds the figurine while praying to Orcus for at least 1 hour has a 10 percent chance of summoning a smokey avatar of the demon lord. Once this avatar is summoned, it can't be summoned again for 30 days. Orcus's avatar has the statistics of a **wraith** except that it's chaotic evil. It attacks all non-undead creatures it encounters, and it disappears after 1 hour or when reduced to 0 hit points.

## Radiance
Wand (Attuned)

*Wand, ??? (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*

While holding this wand, you gain a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls. In addition, you ignore half cover when making a spell attack. Radiance is in the form of an exquisite golden hand mirror.

While surrounded by darkness, it sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius. A creature that is attuned to Radiance can use a bonus action while holding the mirror to cast the [Enhance Ability](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:enhance-ability) spell, choosing itself and no other creature as the spell's target. Once this property of the wand is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Shield of the Silver Dragon
Armor
Source: Curse of Strahd

*Armor (shield), unknown rarity*

This shield is a +2 shield emblazoned with a stylized silver dragon that is the emblem of the Order of the Silver Dragon. The shield whispers warnings to its bearer, granting a +2 bonus to initiative if the bearer isn’t incapacitated.

A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.

## Stonky's Ring
Ring (Attuned)
Source: Candlekeep Mysteries

*Ring, ??? (requires attunement)*

While wearing this ring, you can cast the [Telekinesis](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:telekinesis) spell at will, but you can target only objects that aren't being worn or carried.

Any character who attunes to the ring gains control of Stonky's creations, though the **skitterwidgets** ignore commands spoken more than 30 feet away from them.

## Tearulai
Weapon (Attuned)
Source - Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage

*Weapon (longsword), unknown rarity (requires attunement by a Creature of Non-Evil Alignment)*

The longsword, Tearulai, is a sentient, neutral good *[Sword of Sharpness](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:sword-of-sharpness)* with an emerald-colored blade and precious gemstones embedded in its hilt and pommel. The sword's magical properties are suppressed until it is removed from Valdemar's skull.

When you attack an object with this magic sword and hit, maximize your weapon damage dice against the target.

When you attack a creature with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, that target takes an extra 14 slashing damage. Then roll another d20. If you roll a 20 you lop off one of the target's limbs, with the effect of such loss determined by the DM. If the creature has no limb to sever, you lop off a portion of its body instead.

In addition, you can speak the sword's command word to cause the blade to shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. Speaking the command word again or sheathing the sword puts out the light.

Evil creatures can't attuned to Tearlurai; any evil creature that tries to do so takes 20 psychic damage. The weapon's emerald blade can't be damaged or dulled and the sword can't be teleported anywhere without its wielder while the two are attuned to one another.

**Spells.** The sword has 6 charges and regains 1d4 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. A creature attuned to the sword can use an action to expend 1 or more charges to cast one or more of the following spells from it without material components: *[Fly](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:Fly)* (2 charges), *[Polymorph](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:Polymorph)* (3 charges), or *[Transport via Plants](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:Transport-Via-Plants)* (4 charges)

**Sentience.** The sword has an Intelligence of 17, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 20. It has hearing and truesight out to a range of 120 feet. It communicates telepathically with its attuned wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common, Draconic, Elvish, and Sylvan. In addition, the sword can ascertain the true value of any gemstone brought within 5 feet of it.

**Personality.** Tearulai admires great beauty, music, fine art, and poetry. Vain, the weapon strives to improve its appearance. It craves gemstones and seeks out better ones with which to adorn itself. Most of all, it longs to return to the forests around Myth Drannor, where it was created. If its wielders goals run counter to its own, Tearulau attempts to take control of its wielder and escape Undermountain, whereupon it can use its *[Transport via Plants](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:Transport-Via-Plants)* spell to return whence it came.

## Yester Hill Axe
Weapon
Source: Curse of Strahd

*Weapon (battleaxe), unknown rarity*

Its handle is carved with leaves and vines, and the weapon weighs half as much as a normal battleaxe. When the axe hits a plant, whether an ordinary plant or a plant creature, the target takes an extra 1d8 slashing damage. When a creature of non-good alignment wields the axe, it sprouts thorns whenever its wielder makes an attack with it. These thorns prick the wielder for 1 piercing damage after the attack is made, and this damage is considered magical.
