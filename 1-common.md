The awakened shrub is friendly toward you. Absent commands from you, it does nothing.

## Potion of Climbing

*Potion, common*

When you drink this potion, you gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed for 1 hour. During this time, you have advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks you make to climb. The potion is separated into brown, silver, and gray layers resembling bands of stone. Shaking the bottle fails to mix the colors.

## Potion of Healing

*Potion, rarity varies*

You regain hit points when you drink this potion. The number of hit points depends on the potion's rarity, as shown in the Potions of Healing table. Whatever its potency, the potion's red liquid glimmers when agitated.

## Potion of Watchful Rest
Potion
Source - Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage

*Potion, common*

When you drink this potion, you gain the following benefits for the next 8 hours: magic can't put you to sleep, and you can remain awake during a long rest and still gain its benefits.  
This sweet, amber-colored brew has no effect on creatures that don't require sleep, such as elves.

## Pressure Capsule
Source: Ghosts of Saltmarsh

*Wondrous item, common*

This small capsule is made of beeswax blended with sand and a variety of enchanted water plants. A creature who consumes a *pressure capsule* ignores the effects of swimming at depths greater than 100 feet (see "Unusual Environments" in chapter 5 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*).

## Prosthetic Limb
Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything

*Wondrous item, common*

This item replaces a lost limb a hand, an arm, a foot, a leg, or a similar body part. While the prosthetic is attached, it functions identically to the part it replaces. You can detach or reattach it as an action, and it can't be removed against your will. It detaches if you die.

## Rope of Mending
Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything

*Wondrous item, common*

You can cut this 50-foot coil of hempen rope into any number of smaller pieces, and then use an action to speak a command word and cause the pieces to knit back together. The pieces must be in contact with each other and not otherwise in use. A rope of mending is forever shortened if a section of it is lost or destroyed.

## Ruby of the War Mage
Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything

*Wondrous item, common (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*

Etched with eldritch runes, this 1-inch-diameter ruby allows you to use a simple or martial weapon as a spellcasting focus for your spells. For this property to work, you must attach the ruby to the weapon by pressing the ruby against it for at least 10 minutes. Thereafter, the ruby can't be removed unless you detach it as an action or the weapon is destroyed. Not even an [Antimagic Field](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:antimagic-field) causes it to fall off. The ruby does fall off the weapon if your attunement to the ruby ends.

## Scribe's Pen
Source: Eberron - Rising from the Last War

*Wondrous item, common (requires attunement by a creature with the Mark of Scribing)*

You can use this pen to write on any surface. You decide whether the writing is visible or invisible, but the writing is always visible to a person with the Mark of Scribing.

Any creature with the Mark of Scribing can use an action to touch the invisible writing, making it visible to all.

If you use the pen to write on a creature that isn't a construct, the writing fades after 7 days.

## Sekolahian Worshipping Statuette
Source: Ghosts of Saltmarsh

*Wondrous item, common*

Skillfully carved from sandstone, this 1-foot-tall statuette depicts a shark twisting through the water with its mouth open. If any Tiny sea-dwelling animal is within 1 inch of the statuette's mouth, the shark flashes to life and deals 1 piercing damage to it. The shark can deal damage in this way no more than once per hour.

## Shield of Expression
Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything

*Armor (shield), common*

The front of this shield is shaped in the likeness of a face. While bearing the shield, you can use a bonus action to alter the face's expression.

## Shiftweave
Source: Eberron - Rising from the Last War

*Wondrous item, common*

When a suit of *shiftweave* is created, up to five different outfits can be embedded into the cloth. While wearing the clothing, you can speak its command word as a bonus action to transform your outfit into your choice of one of the other designs contained within it. Regardless of its appearance, the outfit can't be anything but clothing. Although it can duplicate the look of other magical clothing, it doesn't gain their magical properties.

## Smoldering Armor
Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything

*Armor, common*

Wisps of harmless, odorless smoke rise from this armor while it is worn.

## Spell Scroll
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Scroll, rarity varies*

A *spell scroll* bears the words of a single spell, written in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class’s spell list, you can read the scroll and cast its spell without providing any material components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible. Casting the spell by reading the scroll requires the spell’s normal casting time. Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and it crumbles to dust. If the casting is interrupted, the scroll is not lost.

If the spell is on your class's spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect.

Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and the scroll itself crumbles to dust.

The level of the spell on the scroll determines the spell's saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as the scroll's rarity, as shown in the Spell Scroll table.

|Spell Scroll|         |       |            |
|------------|---------|-------|------------|
|Spell Level | Rarity  |Save DC|Attack Bonus|

|    9th     |Legendary|  19   |    \+11    |

A wizard spell on a *spell scroll* can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When a spell is copied from a *spell scroll*, the copier must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the *spell scroll* is destroyed.

## Spellshard
Source: Eberron - Rising from the Last War

*Wondrous item, common*

This polished Eberron dragonshard fits in the hand and stores information similar to a book. The shard can hold the equivalent of one book that's no more than 320 pages long. A shard can be created blank or already filled with information. When the shard is created, the creator can set a passphrase that must be spoken to access the information stored within.

While holding the shard, you can use an action to open your mind to the shard, seeing its content in your mind. On subsequent rounds, reading the text or scribing new text on blank "pages" in the shard requires concentration (as if concentrating on a spell) and takes the same amount of time it takes you to read and write normally. Thinking of a particular phrase or topic draws you to the first section in the shard that addresses it.

A wizard can use a *spellshard* as a spellbook, with the usual cost in gold and time to "scribe" a spell into the shard.

## Spellwrought Tattoo
Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything

*Wondrous item (tattoo), rarity varies*

Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo contains a single spell of up to 5th level, wrought on your skin by a magic needle. To use the tattoo, you must hold the needle against your skin and speak the command word. The needle turns into ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the skin in whatever design you like. Once the tattoo is there, you can cast its spell, requiring no material components. The tattoo glows faintly while you cast the spell and for the spell's duration. Once the spell ends, the tattoo vanishes from your skin.

The level of the spell in the tattoo determines the spell's saving throw DC, attack bonus, spellcasting ability modifier, and the tattoo's rarity, as shown in the Spellwrought Tattoo table.

|Spellwrought Tattoo|        |                             |       |            |

## Staff of Adornment
Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything

*Staff, common*

If you place an object weighing no more than 1 pound (such as a shard of crystal, an egg, or a stone) above the tip of the staff while holding it, the object floats an inch from the staff's tip and remains there until it is removed or until the staff is no longer in your possession. The staff can have up to three such objects floating over its tip at any given time. While holding the staff, you can make one or more of the objects slowly spin or turn in place.

## Staff of Birdcalls
Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything

*Staff, common*

This wooden staff is decorated with bird carvings. It has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge from the staff and cause it to create one of the following sounds out to a range of 60 feet: a finch's chirp, a raven's caw, a duck's quack, a chicken's cluck, a goose's honk, a loon's call, a turkey's gobble, a seagull's cry, an owl's hoot, or an eagle's shriek.

The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff explodes in a harmless cloud of bird feathers and is lost forever.

## Staff of Flowers
Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything

*Staff, common*

This wooden staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge from the staff and cause a flower to sprout from a patch of earth or soil within 5 feet of you, or from the staff itself. Unless you choose a specific kind of flower, the staff creates a mild-scented daisy. The flower is harmless and nonmagical, and it grows or withers as a normal flower would.

The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff turns into flower petals and is lost forever.

## Strixhaven Pennant

*Wondrous Item, Common*

This magic pennant bears the symbol of Strixhaven or one of its colleges: Lorehold, Prismari, Quandrix, Silverquill, or Witherbloom. While you wave the pennant, the symbol on it glitters, and the pennant sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.

## Talking Doll
Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything

*Wondrous item, common (requires attunement)*

While this stuffed doll is within 5 feet of you, you can spend a short rest telling it to say up to six phrases, none of which can be more than six words long, and set a condition under which the doll speaks each phrase. You can also replace old phrases with new ones. Whatever the condition, it must occur within 5 feet of the doll to make it speak. For example, whenever someone picks up the doll, it might say, "I want a piece of candy." The doll's phrases are lost when your attunement to the doll ends.

## Tankard of Plenty
Source: Tyranny of the Dragonqueen (Errata)

*Wondrous item, Common.*

This golden stein is decorated with dancing dwarves and grain patterns. If you speak the command word (“Illefarn”) while grasping the handle, the tankard fills with three pints of rich dwarven ale. The tankard has 3 charges. Using the tankard’s property expends 1 charge, and the tankard regains all expended charges daily at dawn.

## Tankard of Sobriety
Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything

This clockwork device resembles a metal crab the size of a dinner plate. Every action used to wind up the device allows it to operate for 1 minute, to a maximum of 10 minutes. While operational, the item uses the accompanying **vox seeker** stat block. This automaton is under the DM's control. A vox seeker reduced to 0 hit points is destroyed.

* You can insert a wand into the sheath as an action. The sheath can hold only one wand at a time.
* You can retract or extend a wand from the sheath as a bonus action. While the wand is extended, you can use it as if you were holding it, but your hand remains free.

If a sheathed wand requires attunement, you must attune to the wand before you can use it. However, the *wand sheath* and the attached wand count as a single magic item with regard to the number of magic items you can attune to. If you remove the wand from the sheath, your attunement to the wand ends.
