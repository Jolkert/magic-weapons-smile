## Apparatus of Kwalish
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, legendary*

This item first appears to be a Large sealed iron barrel weighing 500 pounds. The barrel has a hidden catch, which can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the catch unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or smaller creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to move either up or down. When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster.

The apparatus of Kwalish is a Large object with the following statistics:

|                                  **Armor Class:** 20                                   |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                                  **Hit Points:** 200                                   |
|**Speed:** 30 ft., swim 30 ft., (or 0 ft. for both if the legs and tail aren't extended)|
|                         **Damage Immunities:** poison, psychic                         |

To be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the apparatus's hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.

The apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute from pressure.

A creature in the compartment can use an action to move as many as two of the apparatus's levers up or down. After each use, a lever goes back to its neutral position. Each lever, from left to right, functions as shown in the Apparatus of Kwalish Levers table.

## Armor, +1, +2, or +3
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Armor (light, medium, or heavy), rare (+1), very rare (+2), or legendary (+3)*

You have a bonus to AC while wearing this armor. The bonus is determined by its rarity.

## Armor of Invulnerability
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Armor (plate), legendary (requires attunement)*

You have resistance to nonmagical damage while you wear this armor. Additionally, you can use an action to make yourself immune to nonmagical damage for 10 minutes or until you are no longer wearing the armor. Once this special action is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Azuredge
Source: Waterdeep - Dragon Heist

*Weapon (battleaxe), legendary (requires attunement)*

Forged by the archwizard Ahghairon, this intelligent battleaxe was crafted to defend Waterdeep. Its current wielder is a former member of Force Grey named Meloon Wardragon, but the weapon is searching for a new owner.

*Azuredge* has a solid steel handle etched with tiny runes, wrapped in blue dragon hide with a star sapphire set into the pommel. The axe head is forged from silver, electrum, and steel alloys whose edges constantly shimmer with a deep blue luminescence.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The [Shield](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:shield) spell provides no defense against the axe, which passes through that spell's barrier of magical force.

When you hit a fiend or an undead with the axe, cold blue flames erupt from its blade and deal an extra 2d6 radiant damage to the target.

***Hurling.*** The battleaxe has 3 charges. You can expend 1 charge and make a ranged attack with the axe, hurling it as if it had the thrown property with a normal range of 60 feet and a long range of 180 feet. Whether it hits or misses, the axe flies back to you at the end of the current turn, landing in your open hand or al your feet in your space (as you choose). The axe regains all expended charges daily at dawn.

***Illumination.*** While holding the axe, you can use an action to cause the axe to glow blue or to quench the glow. This glow sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.

***Sentience.*** *Azuredge* is a sentient lawful neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 15. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common. It has a calm, delicate voice. The weapon can sense the presence of non-lawful creatures within 120 feet of it.

***Personality.*** *Azuredge* is sworn to protect Waterdeep, and it desires to be wielded by a law-abiding person willing to dedicate everything to the city's defense. The weapon is patient and takes its time finding its ideal wielder.

If someone tries to use *Azuredge* against its will, the axe can become ten times heavier than normal, and can magically adhere to any Medium or larger object or surface it comes into contact with. Once it does so, the axe can't be wielded. Nothing short of a [Wish](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:wish) spell can separate the axe from the item or surface to which it is adhered without destroying one or the other, though the axe can choose to end the effect at any time.

## Belashyrra's Beholder Crown
Source: Eberron - Rising from the Last War

*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*

This symbiotic crown is carved from dark purple and mauve stone, with ten points like stalks set with gemstones resembling the eyestalks of a beholder. To attune to this item, you must wear it on your head for the entire attunement period, during which the crown's hidden tendrils burrow into your scalp to bond with your skull.

While wearing the crown, you can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 120 feet.

***Spells.*** The crown has 10 charges. While wearing it, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it (spell save DC 16): [Charm Person](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:charm-person) (1 charge), [Disintegrate](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:disintegrate) (6 charges), [Fear](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:fear) (3 charges), [Finger of Death](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:finger-of-death) (7 charges), [Flesh to Stone](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:flesh-to-stone) (6 charges), [Hold Person](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:hold-person) (2 charges), [Ray of Enfeeblement](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:ray-of-enfeeblement) (2 charges), [Sleep](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:sleep) (1 charge), [Slow](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:slow) (3 charges), [Telekinesis](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:telekinesis) (5 charges).

The crown regains 1d6 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn.

***Symbiotic Nature.*** The crown can't be removed from you while you're attuned to it, and you can't voluntarily end your attunement to it. If you're targeted by a spell that ends a curse, your attunement to the crown ends, and it detaches from you.

The daelkyr Belashyrra made these crowns. While on the same plane of existence as the crown, Belashyrra can see through its eyestalks.

## Belt of Giant Strength
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement)*

While wearing this belt, your Strength score changes to a score granted by the belt. If your Strength is already equal to or greater than the belt's score, the item has no effect on you.

Six varieties of this belt exist, corresponding with and having rarity according to the six kinds of true giants. The *Belt of Stone Giant Strength* and the *Belt of Frost Giant Strength* look different, but they have the same effect.

|      Type       |Strength| Rarity  |
|-----------------|--------|---------|
|   Hill Giant    |   21   |  Rare   |
|Stone/Frost Giant|   23   |Very Rare|
|   Fire Giant    |   25   |Very Rare|
|   Cloud Giant   |   27   |Legendary|
|   Storm Giant   |   29   |Legendary|

## Black Crystal Tablet
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source - Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage

*Wondrous Item, Legendary (requires attunement by a creature that has proficiency in the Arcana skill)*

Any creature that attunes to the tablet must make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw at the end of its next long rest. On a failed save, the creature becomes afflicted with a random form of long-term madness (see "Madness" in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).

As an action, a creature attuned to the *Black Crystal Tablet* can use it to cast *[Eyebite](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:Eyebite)* or *[Gate](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:Gate)* (the portal created by this spell links to the Far Realm only). After the tablet is used to cast a spell, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.

## Blackrazor
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Weapon (greatsword), legendary (requires attunement by a creature of non-lawful alignment)*

Hidden in the dungeon of White Plume Mountain, *Blackrazor* shines like a piece of night sky filled with stars. Its black scabbard is decorated with pieces of cut obsidian.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. It has the following additional properties.

**Devour Soul.** Whenever you use it to reduce a creature to 0 hit points, the sword slays the creature and devours its soul, unless it is a construct or an undead. A creature whose soul has been devoured by *Blackrazor* can be restored to life only by a [Wish](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:wish) spell.

When it devours a soul, *Blackrazor* grants you temporary hit points equal to the slain creature's hit point maximum. These hit points fade after 24 hours. As long as these temporary hit points last and you keep *Blackrazor* in hand, you have advantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks.

If you hit an undead with this weapon, you take 1d10 necrotic damage and the target regains 1d10 hit points. If this necrotic damage reduces you to 0 hit points, *Blackrazor* devours your soul.

**Soul Hunter.** While you hold the weapon. you are aware of the presence of Tiny or larger creatures within 60 feet of you that aren't constructs or undead. You also can't be charmed or frightened.

*Blackrazor* can cast the [Haste](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:haste) spell on you once per day. It decides when to cast the spell and maintains concentration on it so that you don't have to.

**Sentience.** *Blackrazor* is a sentient chaotic neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 17, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 19. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon can speak, read, and understand Common, and can communicate with its wielder telepathically. Its voice is deep and echoing. While you are attuned to it, *Blackrazor* also understands every language you know.

**Personality.** *Blackrazor* speaks with an imperious tone, as though accustomed to being obeyed. The sword's purpose is to consume souls. It doesn't care whose souls it eats, including the wielder's. The sword believes that all matter and energy sprang from a void of negative energy and will one day return to it. *Blackrazor* is meant to hurry that process along.

Despite its nihilism, *Blackrazor* feels a strange kinship to Wave and Whelm, two other weapons locked away under White Plume Mountain. It wants the three weapons to be united again and wielded together in combat, even though it violently disagrees with *Whelm* and finds *Wave* tedious.

*Blackrazor's* hunger for souls must be regularly fed. If the sword goes three days or more without consuming a soul, a conflict between it and its wielder occurs at the next sunset.

## Blackstaff
Source: Waterdeep - Dragon Heist

*Staff, legendary (requires attunement by the Blackstaff heir, who must be a wizard)*

The *Blackstaff* is a sentient, rune-carved staff set with thin silver veins. It is the symbol of office for the Blackstaff, the highest ranking wizard in Waterdeep. As the rightful owner of the *Blackstaff*, Vajra Safahr is the only one who can become attuned to it. The staff can, however, choose a new owner (see "Personality" below).

The *Blackstaff* has the magical properties of a *[staff of power](/wondrous-items:staff-of-power)* in addition to the following properties.

***Animate Walking Statues.*** You can expend 1 or more of the staff's charges as an action to animate or deactivate one or more of the walking statues of Waterdeep. You must be in the city to use this property, and you can animate or deactivate one statue for each charge expended. An animated statue obeys the telepathic commands of Khelben Arunsun's spirit, which is trapped inside the staff (see "Personality" below). A walking statue becomes inanimate if deactivated or if the staff is broken.

***Dispel Magic.*** You can expend 1 of the staff's charges as a bonus action to cast *[dispel magic](/spell:dispel-magic)* on a creature, an object, or a magical effect that you touch with the tip of the staff. If the target is an unwilling creature or an object in the possession of such a creature, you must hit the creature with a melee attack using the *Blackstaff* before you can expend the charge to cast the spell.

***Drain Magic.*** This property affects only creatures that use spell slots. When you hit such a creature with a melee attack using the *Blackstaff*, you can expend 1 of the staff's charges as a bonus action, causing the target to expend one spell slot of the highest spell level it can cast without casting a spell. If the target has already expended all its spell slots, nothing happens. Spell slots that are expended in this fashion are regained when the target finishes a long rest, as normal.

***Master of Enchantment.*** When you cast an enchantment spell of 1st level or higher while holding the staff, you can make an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC of 10 + the level of the spell. If the check succeeds, you cast the spell without expending a spell slot.

***Sentience.*** The *Blackstaff* is a sentient staff of neutral alignment, with an Intelligence of 22, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet, and it can communicate telepathically with any creature that is holding it.

***Personality.*** The staff has the spirits of all previous Blackstaffs trapped within it. Its creator, Khelben Arunsun, is the dominant personality among them. Like Khelben, the staff is extremely devious and manipulative. It prefers to counsel its owner without exerting outright control. The staff's primary goal is to protect Waterdeep and its Open Lord, currently Laeral Silverhand. Its secondary goal is to help its wielder become more powerful.

In the event that the holder of the office of the Blackstaff no longer serves the staff's wishes, the staff ceases to function until it finds a worthy inheritor—someone whose loyalty to Waterdeep is beyond reproach.

***Spirit Trap.*** When the Blackstaff dies, the spirit of that individual becomes trapped in the staff along with the spirits of the previous Blackstaffs. (A Blackstaff whose spirit is trapped in the staff can't be raised from the dead.)

Destroying the staff would release the spirits trapped inside it, but in that event, Khelben's spirit can lodge itself inside any one piece of the staff that remains. The piece containing Khelben's spirit has the staff's Sentience property but none of its other properties. As long as this piece of the staff exists, Khelben's spirit can make the staff whole again whenever he wishes. When the staff is remade, the spirits of the previous Blackstaffs become trapped inside it again.

## Blood Fury Tattoo
Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything

*Wondrous item (tattoo), legendary (requires attunement)*

Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo evokes fury in its form and colors.

**Tattoo Attunement.** To attune to this item, you hold the needle to your skin where you want the tattoo to appear, pressing the needle there throughout the attunement process. When the attunement is complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the skin.

If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo vanishes, and the needle reappears in your space.

**Bloodthirsty Strikes.** The tattoo has 10 charges, and it regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While this tattoo is on your skin, you gain the following benefits:

* When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend a charge to deal an extra 4d6 necrotic damage to the target, and you regain a number of hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt.

* When a creature you can see damages you, you can expend a charge and use your reaction to make a melee attack against that creature, with advantage on your attack roll.

## Bookmark
Source: Tomb of Annihilation

*Weapon (dagger), legendary (requires attunement)*

This +3 dagger belongs to Artus Cimber. While you have the dagger drawn, you can use a bonus action to activate one of the following properties:

* Cause a blue gem set into the dagger's pommel to shed bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet, or make the gem go dark.
* Turn the dagger into a compass that, while resting on your palm, points north.

* Cast [Compulsion](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:compulsion) (save DC 15) from the dagger. The range of the spell increases to 90 feet, but it targets only spiders that are beasts. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Cloak of Invisibility
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*

While wearing this cloak, you can pull its hood over your head to cause yourself to become invisible. While you are invisible, anything you are carrying or wearing is invisible with you. You become visible when you cease wearing the hood. Pulling the hood up or down requires an action.

Deduct the time you are invisible, in increments of 1 minute, from the cloak's maximum duration of 2 hours. After 2 hours of use, the cloak ceases to function. For every uninterrupted period of 12 hours, the cloak goes unused, it regains 1 hour of duration.

## Crystal Ball
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, very rare or legendary (requires attunement)*

The typical *crystal ball*, a very rare item, is about 6 inches in diameter. While touching it, you can cast the [Scrying](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:scrying) spell (save DC 17) with it.

The following *crystal ball* variants are legendary items and have additional properties.

***Crystal Ball of Mind Reading.*** You can use an action to cast the [Detect Thoughts](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:detect-thoughts) spell (save DC 17) while you are scrying with the crystal ball, targeting creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor. You don't need to concentrate on this [Detect Thoughts](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:detect-thoughts) to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if scrying ends.

***Crystal Ball of Telepathy.*** While scrying with the crystal ball, you can communicate telepathically with creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor. You can also use an action to cast the [Suggestion](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:suggestion) spell (save DC 17) through the sensor on one of those creatures. You don't need to concentrate on this [Suggestion](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:suggestion) to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if scrying ends. Once used, the [Suggestion](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:suggestion) power of the *crystal ball* can't be used again until the next dawn.

***Crystal Ball of True Seeing.*** While scrying with the crystal ball, you have truesight with a radius of 120 feet centered on the spell's sensor.

## Cubic Gate
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, legendary*

This cube is 3 inches across and radiates palpable magical energy. The six sides of the cube are each keyed to a different plane of existence, one of which is the Material Plane. The other sides are linked to planes determined by the DM.

You can use an action to press one side of the cube to cast the [Gate](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:gate) spell with it, opening a portal to the plane keyed to that side. Alternatively, if you use an action to press one side twice, you can cast the [Plane Shift](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:plane-shift) spell (save DC 17) with the cube and transport the targets to the plane keyed to that side.

The cube has 3 charges. Each use of the cube expends 1 charge. The cube regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.

## Danoth's Visor
Source: Explorer's Guide to Wildemount

*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*

These mithral-frame goggles with clear diamond lenses were used by the evoker Danoth Oro to spot invisible enemies and scout areas from afar.

***Dormant.*** While wearing the goggles in their dormant state, you can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 60 feet. Additionally, you have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

***Awakened.*** When *Danoth's Visor* reaches an awakened state, it gains the following properties:

* You see invisible creatures and objects within 60 feet of you as if they were visible, and you can see into the Ethereal Plane. Ethereal creatures and objects appear ghostly and translucent.
* As a bonus action, you can speak a command word and use the goggles to see into and through solid matter. This vision has a radius of 60 feet and lasts for 1 minute. To you, solid objects within that radius appear transparent. The vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances block the vision, as does a thin sheet of lead. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.
* As a bonus action, you can speak a command word to switch the goggles into spyglass mode. While in this mode, creatures and objects viewed through the goggles are magnified to twice their size. Speaking the command word again reverts the goggles to their normal operation.

***Exalted.*** When Danoth's Visor reaches an exalted state, it gains the following properties:

* You automatically detect illusions you can see and automatically succeed on saving throws against them. In addition, you see a bright aura around any creature that isn't in its true form.
* As an action, you can cast the [Antimagic Field](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:antimagic-field) spell from the visor. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Dawnbringer
Source: Out of the Abyss

*Weapon (longsword), legendary (requires attunement by a creature of non-evil alignment)*

Lost for ages in the Underdark, *Dawnbringer* appears to be a gilded longsword hilt. While grasping the hilt, you can use a bonus action to make a blade of pure radiance spring from the hilt, or cause the blade to disappear. *Dawnbringer* has all the properties of a [Sun Blade](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:sun-blade).

While holding the weapon, you can use an action to touch a creature with the blade and cast [Lesser Restoration](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:lesser-restoration) on that creature. Once used, this ability can't be used again until the next dawn.

***Sentience.*** *Dawnbringer* is a sentient neutral good weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 14. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

The sword can speak, read, and understand Common, and it can communicate with its wielder telepathically. Its voice is kind and feminine. It knows every language you know while you're attuned to it.

***Personality.*** Forged by ancient sun worshippers, *Dawnbringer* is meant to bring light into darkness and to fight creatures of darkness. It is kind and compassionate to those in need, but fierce and destructive to its enemies.

Long years lost in darkness have made *Dawnbringer* frightened of both the dark and abandonment. It prefers that its blade always be present and shedding light in areas of darkness, and it strongly resists being parted from its wielder for any length of time.

## Deck Of Many More Things
Source: The Book of Many Things

*Wondrous item, legendary*

Over the centuries since the first Deck of Many Things was created, many have sought and failed to replicate it. But some have created new cards. These forty-four additional cards are known collectively as the Deck of Many More Things.  
Like the Deck of Many Things, the Deck of Many More Things manifests differently on various worlds. While it can include fewer or different cards, it frequently appears with a Deck of Many Things as part of a combined deck of sixty-six illuminated cards. The combined deck is usually protected by a box or pouch. The forty-four cards of the Deck of Many More Things bear similar imagery to those in the Deck of Many Things and have potent magical effects, which are detailed later in this description. Notably, cards from the Deck of Many More Things are more likely to be beneficial, though about a third of them are still dangerous.

Before you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly. Unless a card allows you to draw additional cards, any cards drawn exceeding this number have no effect.

As soon as you draw a card, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card you declared no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. Unless a card states otherwise, if you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck and take effect simultaneously.

Unless it is the Fool or the Jester card, a drawn card immediately takes effect, fades from existence, and reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card multiple times.

The DM can use the physical cards provided in The Deck of Many Things card set to build a combined Deck of Many Things and Deck of Many More Things, including whichever cards they desire. Alternatively, roll on the Deck of Many More Things table below to randomly determine what cards are drawn.

\*Found in the Deck of Many Things as depicted in the *Dungeon Master’s Guide*

**Aberration.** You gain telepathy within a range of 90 feet.

**Balance\*.** Your mind suffers a wrenching alteration, causing your alignment to change. Lawful become chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice versa. If you are true neutral or unaligned, this card has no effect on you.

**Beast.** You immediately transform into a random Beast with a CR of 5 or lower. Your game statistics—including your ability scores, hit points, and possible actions—are replaced by the Beast’s game statistics, and any nonmagical equipment you’re wearing or carrying melds into your new form and can’t be used. Any magic items you’re carrying drop in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of your new form.

You remain transformed in this way for 2d12 days; nothing can alter your form while you’re under the effects of this card, but the [Wish](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:wish) spell can end the transformation early. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the same state you were in when you initially transformed.

**Book.** You gain the ability to speak, read, and write 1d6 + 2 languages of your choice.

**Bridge.** You gain the ability to cast the [Time Stop](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:time-stop) spell 1d3 times. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice).

**Campfire.** You immediately gain the benefits of finishing a long rest.

**Cavern.** You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. You also gain the ability to move up, down, across vertical surfaces, and along ceilings, while leaving your hands free.

**Celestial.** You sprout a pair of softly luminescent, feathered wings from your back and gain a flying speed of 30 feet.

**Comet\*.** If you single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or group of monsters you encounter, you gain experience points enough to gain one level. Otherwise, this card has no effect.

**Construct.** A homunculus appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. The appearance of the homunculus is determined by the DM, and the homunculus treats you as its creator.

**Corpse.** You immediately drop to 0 hit points, have the unconscious condition, and must begin making death saving throws. Spells and other magical effects that restore hit points have no effect on you until you are stabilized. If you fail three death saving throws, you die and can be resurrected only by the [Wish](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:wish) spell.

**Crossroads.** Roll a d20. If the roll is even, you age 1d10 years. If the roll is odd, you become younger by 1d10 years, to a minimum of 1 year. This effect can be undone only by the [Wish](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:wish) spell, divine intervention, or similar magic.

**Donjon\*.** You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you were wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can't be located by any divination magic, but a [Wish](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:wish) spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.

**Door.** You gain the ability to cast the [Gate](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:gate) spell 1d4 times, requiring no material components. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice).

**Dragon.** A dragon egg appears at your feet and immediately hatches into a dragon wyrmling. The type of dragon is chosen by the DM. The wyrmling views you as its parent and is staunchly loyal to you and your allies.

**Elemental.** You become immune to one of the following damage types (choose immediately upon drawing this card): acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.

**Euryale\*.** The card's medusa-like visage curses you. You take a -2 penalty on saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of The Fates card can end this curse.

**Expert.** Your Dexterity score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22.

**Fates\*.** Reality's fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card's magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.

**Fey.** A fey crossing opens into the Feywild, and you’re immediately pulled through it, disappearing in a flash of rainbow-colored light. You draw no more cards.

The fey crossing appears as a shimmering fractal of light above the deck, and it remains open for 1 minute after the card is drawn. The precise location in the Feywild to which the fey crossing leads is determined by the DM.

**Fiend.** A powerful Fiend appears in a nearby unoccupied space and offers you a deal. The precise nature of this deal is up to the DM, but usually the Fiend offers some material reward in exchange for you and your allies completing a task for the Fiend. The Fiend is indifferent to you and can be bargained with; it keeps its side of any bargain it makes, though it might twist the wording of any agreement to suit its purposes. If attacked, or if negotiations fail and you refuse the Fiend’s offer, it returns to its home plane.

**Flames\*.** A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and plagues your life, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.

**Fool\*.** You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. If losing that much XP would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level.

**Gem\*.** Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 gp each or fifty gems worth 1,000 gp each appear at your feet.

**Giant.** You immediately grow 2d10 inches in height, and your hit point maximum and current hit points both increase by 20.

**Humanoid.** You can immediately choose to stop drawing from the deck, regardless of how many cards you initially declared.

**Jester\*.** You gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.

**Key\*.** A rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears in your hands. The DM chooses the weapon.

**Knight\*.** You gain the service of a 4th-level fighter who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The fighter is of the same race as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the fates have drawn him or her to you. You control this character.

**Lance.** All your ability scores increase by 1, to a maximum of 20.

**Mage.** Your Intelligence score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22.

**Map.** At any time you choose within 1 year of drawing this card, you can mentally name or describe an object or individual that is familiar to you. You immediately know the location of the object or individual, as well as the distance between you and the object or individual, even if the object or individual is on a different plane of existence. If you named an individual, you know if they are alive and any conditions they have. If you named an object, you know if it is broken or not. If you named a magic item that has charges, you know how many charges it has remaining.

**Maze.** You gain 1d3 levels of exhaustion.

**Mine.** A pile of 2d6 gems (each worth 5,000 gp) and 1d10 chunks of precious ore (each worth 2,500 gp) appears at your feet.

**Monstrosity**. A Large or larger Monstrosity with a challenge rating of 10 or less (chosen by the DM) appears in an unoccupied space within 15 feet of you. The creature is hostile toward you and attacks immediately. The creature disappears when it is killed or when you are reduced to 0 hit points. If there isn’t enough space for a Large or larger creature to appear, this card has no effect.

**Moon\*.** You are granted the ability to cast the [Wish](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:wish) spell 1d3 times.

**Ooze.** A gelatinous cube immediately appears in your space and engulfs you. The gelatinous cube is hostile and remains until it is destroyed. If there isn’t enough space for the gelatinous cube to appear, this card has no effect.

**Path.** Your walking speed increases by 10 feet.

**Pit.** A pit opens beneath you. You plummet 3d6 × 10 feet, take damage from the fall, and have the prone condition.

**Plant.** You gain the ability to cast [Speak with Plants](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:speak-with-plants) without using a spell slot; you must finish a long rest before you can cast it this way again. If you have spell slots of 3rd level or higher, you can cast this spell using them. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice).

**Priest.** Your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22.

**Prisoner.** Glowing chains made of magical force appear and wrap around you. You have the restrained condition until the chains are destroyed or you are freed. While you have this condition, you can’t cast spells, and any magic items you’re wearing or carrying have their properties suppressed. You draw no more cards. The chains are immune to damage and can’t be dispelled using the [Dispel Magic](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:dispel-magic) spell or similar magic. However, a [Disintegrate](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:disintegrate) spell destroys the chains instantly, freeing you. Another creature can also free you by succeeding on a DC 30 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools.

**Puzzle\*.** Permanently reduce your Intelligence by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.

**Ring.** A rare or rarer magic ring appears on your finger. If you have the attunement slots available, you’re automatically attuned to the ring when it appears. The DM chooses the ring.

**Rogue\*.** A nonplayer character of the DM's choice becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn't known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a [Wish](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:wish) spell or divine intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you.

**Ruin\*.** All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.

**Sage\*.** At any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question. Besides information, the answer helps you solve a puzzling problem or other dilemma. In other words, the knowledge comes with wisdom on how to apply it.

**Shield.** A rare or rarer suit of magic armor that you are proficient with appears in your hands. The DM chooses the armor. If you lack proficiency with any armor, your base AC instead now equals 12 + your Dexterity modifier while you aren’t wearing armor.

**Ship.** You gain proficiency in three skills chosen by the DM.

**Skull\*.** You summon an avatar of death-a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the DM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death. A creature slain by an avatar of death can't be restored to life.

**Staff.** A rare or rarer magic rod, staff, or wand appears in your hands. The DM chooses the item.

**Stairway.** You can choose to either decrease your number of declared draws by two or receive a rare or rarer wondrous item, which appears in your hands. The DM chooses the item.

**Star\*.** Increase one of your ability scores by 2. The score can exceed 20 but can't exceed 24.

**Statue.** You immediately have the petrified condition as your body is transformed into marble. The petrification lasts until you are freed with the [Greater Restoration](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:greater-restoration) spell or similar magic.

**Sun\*.** You gain 50,000 XP, and a wondrous item (which the DM determines randomly) appears in your hands.

**Talons\*.** Every magic item you wear or carry disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession aren't destroyed but do vanish.

**Tavern.** Your Charisma score increases by 2 to a maximum of 22.

**Temple.** A deity or entity of similar power becomes bound to aid you. At any point in time between drawing the card and when you die, you can use your action to call on this entity for divine intervention, and the entity is bound to answer. The parameters and nature of this intervention are chosen by the DM. If you die without having used this intervention, the deity fulfills its obligation by casting the [Resurrection](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:resurrection) spell on you. Once the entity has answered your call for divine intervention or resurrected you, the entity is no longer bound to aid you.

**Throne\*.** You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill, and you double your proficiency bonus on checks made with that skill. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently in the hands of monsters, which you must clear out before you can claim the keep as yours.

**Tomb.** At any time you choose within 1 year of drawing this card, you can cast the [True Resurrection](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:true-resurrection) spell once without expending a spell slot or requiring material components. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice).

**Tower.** Draw two additional cards beyond your declared number of draws. The magic of these cards doesn’t immediately take effect; instead, choose one of the two additional cards to keep, returning the other to the deck. The magic of the card you keep takes effect immediately thereafter.

**Tree.** Your skin immediately becomes rough, like tree bark. Your base AC now equals 15 + your Dexterity modifier while you aren’t wearing armor, but you have vulnerability to fire damage. This transformation can be undone only by the [Wish](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:wish) spell, divine intervention, or similar magic.

**Undead.** Somewhere on the Material Plane, a revenant rises. This revenant blames you for its existence and relentlessly hunts you to exact its revenge. The revenant exists until either 1 year passes, the revenant kills you, or you use a [Wish](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:wish) spell to banish it permanently to the afterlife.

**Void\*.** This black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the DM's choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is incapacitated. A [Wish](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:wish) spell can't restore your soul, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds it. You draw no more cards.

**Warrior.** Your Strength score increases by 2 to a maximum of 22.

**Well.** You learn three cantrips of your choice from any spell list.

## Deck of Many Things
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, legendary*

Usually found in a box or pouch, this deck contains a number of cards made of ivory or vellum. Most (75 percent) of these decks have only thirteen cards, but the rest have twenty-two.

Before you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at once.

Once a card is drawn, it fades from existence. Unless the card is the Fool or the Jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice.

### Effects for Single Cards (Book of Many Things) ###

A Deck of Many Things typically appears not as individual cards, but as a collection of cards characters can draw from. But this doesn’t have to be true; you can give each card a property as a standalone item, so characters who find only one card can still enjoy this famed item and use the card on adventures.

This approach is particularly useful if you make a Deck of Many Things the object of a quest; as the characters explore, each card they find grants them a magical ability they can use in subsequent adventures to find the cards that remain. Eventually the heroes assemble the entire deck, which they can then use in the traditional manner, drawing transformative cards from it in a fitting climax to the campaign.

You can grant the following additional magical properties to the cards of the Deck of Many Things:

**Balance.** As an action, you can brandish this card at one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself and drain its life force. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or take 4d8 necrotic damage. You then regain a number of hit points equal to the necrotic damage the target takes. Once this property is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

**Comet.** As an action, you can hold this card aloft and call down a fiery meteor to a point you can see within 120 feet of yourself. Each creature within a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d6 bludgeoning damage and 6d6 fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. Once this property is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

**Donjon.** As an action, you can brandish this card at one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Charisma saving throw, or it vanishes, transported to a prison on another plane of existence.

**Euryale.** As an action, you can brandish this card at one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself and attempt to turn it to stone. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, or it begins to turn to stone and has the restrained condition. The affected target must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the effect ends on the target. On a failed save, the target has the petrified condition (instead of the restrained condition) until it is removed by the [Greater Restoration](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:Greater-Restoration) spell or similar magic.

The devil is initially unfriendly toward you and your companions. Roll initiative for the devil, which has its own turns. The DM has the creature’s stat block. On each of your turns, you can issue a verbal command to the devil (no action required by you), and as long as you are holding this card, the devil obeys your commands. Otherwise, it is under the DM’s control and acts according to its nature—it might attack you if it thinks it can prevail or try to tempt you to undertake an evil act in exchange for further service. After 1 minute or when the devil’s hit points drop to 0, the devil returns to the Lower Planes. Once this property is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

The deck defender obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, it takes the Dodge action and moves to avoid danger. The deck defender reverts to a card early if it drops to 0 hit points. Once this property is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

**Moon.** As an action, you can speak a command word while touching this card and transform into a wolflike biped for 1 minute.

## Deck of Several Things
Source: Lost Laboratory of Kwalish

*Wondrous item, legendary*

Stored in a leather pouch, this unique deck contains twenty-two colored cards made of some strong but unknown metal, each of which features a design printed as a mosaic of raised dots. Before you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at once.

Once a card is drawn, it fades from existence. Unless the card is the Fool or the Jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice.

|   Playing Card   |  Card   |
|------------------|---------|
| Ace of diamonds  | Vizier  |
| King of diamonds |   Sun   |

|Joker (without TM)| Jester  |

***Balance.*** Your mind suffers a wrenching alteration, causing your alignment to change. Lawful become chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice versa. If you are true neutral or unaligned, this card has no effect on you.

***Comet.*** If you single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or group of monsters you encounter, you gain experience points enough to gain one level. Otherwise, this card has no effect.

***Donjon.*** You are instantly teleported to and confined within the prison of the Monastery of the Distressed Body. Everything you were wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You draw no more cards.

***Euryale.*** The card's medusa-like visage curses you. You take a -1 penalty on saving throws for the duration of the adventure.

***The Fates.*** Reality's fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card's magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.

***Flames.*** The Grand Master of the Monastery of the Distressed Body becomes your enemy. The bone devil seeks your ruin, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. If the Grand Master has already been defeated, you gain the enmity of Garret Levistusson’s patron — a similarly powerful devil.

***Fool.*** For the duration of the adventure, you lose proficiency with one skill or gain disadvantage on all checks made with one skill (with the skill and the penalty determined by the DM). Discard this card and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws.

***Gem.*** The 1,000 gp hoard of the leprechaun from the Wilderness Encounters table appears at your feet. If that treasure has already been claimed, you gain an equivalent hoard.

***Idiot.*** Reduce your Intelligence by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1) for the duration of the adventure. You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.

***Jester.*** You gain proficiency in a skill of your choice for the duration of the adventure, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.

***Key.*** A common or uncommon magic weapon with which you are proficient, or a [Spell Scroll](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:spell-scroll) featuring a spell of a level you can cast, appears in your hands. The DM chooses the weapon or spell, which you possess for the duration of this adventure.

***Knight.*** You gain the service of any of the NPCs in the “Hirelings” section not currently with the party, who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The NPC serves you loyally for the duration of the adventure, believing that the fates have drawn them to you. You control this character.

***Moon.*** You are granted the ability to cast any spell of 5th level or lower, and can use that ability 1d3 times for the duration of the adventure.

***Rogue.*** An NPC of the DM’s choice becomes secretly hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn’t known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Any enchantment spell cast on the NPC at 6th level or higher can end the NPC’s hostility toward you.

***Ruin.*** All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. This wealth can be recovered either in the treasury of the Monastery of the Distressed Body or Kwalish’s lab in Daoine Gloine, whichever comes later in the adventure.

***Skull.*** You summon an avatar of death — a mechanical skeleton (use **bone naga** statistics) clad in a tattered black robe. It appears in a space of the DM’s choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death. A creature slain by an avatar of death can’t be restored to life

***Star.*** Increase one of your ability scores by 1 for the duration of the adventure. The score can exceed 20 but can’t exceed 24.

***Sun.*** You gain proficiency in the skill of your choice for the duration of the adventure. In addition, a common or uncommon wondrous item appears in your hands. The DM chooses the item, which you possess for the duration of this adventure.

***Talons.*** Every magic item you wear or carry is lost to you. These items can be recovered either in the treasury of the Monastery of the Distressed Body or Kwalish’s lab in Daoine Gloine, whichever comes later in the adventure.

***Throne.*** You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill and you double your proficiency bonus on checks made with that skill for the duration of the adventure. In addition, the Monastery of the Distressed Body’s brains in jars regard you thereafter as the monastery’s rightful master. You must defeat or otherwise clear out the Grand Master and its servants before you can claim the monastery as yours.

***Vizier.*** At any one time you choose within the duration of the adventure, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question. Besides information, the answer helps you solve a puzzling problem or other dilemma. In other words, the knowledge comes with wisdom on how to apply it.

***The Void.*** This black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and held within machinery in either the control room of the Monastery of the Distressed Body or Kwalish’s lab in Daoine Gloine, whichever comes later in the adventure. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is incapacitated. [Divination](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:divination), [Contact Other Plane](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:contact-other-plane), or a similar spell of 4th level or higher reveals the location of the machinery that holds your soul. You draw no more cards.

## Figurine of Wondrous Power
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide, Fizban's Treasury of Dragons

*Wondrous item, rarity by figurine*

A *Figurine of Wondrous Power* is a statuette of a beast small enough to fit in a pocket. If you use an action to speak the command word and throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the figurine becomes a living creature. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn't become a creature.

The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions. See the *Monster Manuel* for the creature's statistics.

The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine's description.

***Bronze Griffon (Rare).*** This bronze statuette is of a griffon rampant. It can become a **griffon** for up to 6 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 5 days have passed.

***Ebony Fly (Rare).*** This ebony statuette is carved in the likeness of a horsefly. It can become a **giant fly** for up to 12 hours and can be ridden as a mount. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed.

***Golden Lions (Rare).*** These gold statuettes of lions are always created in pairs. You can use one figurine or both simultaneously. Each can become a **lion** for up to 1 hour. Once a lion has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

***Ivory Goats (Rare).*** These ivory statuettes of goats are always created in sets of three. Each goat looks unique and functions differently from the others. Their properties are as follows

* The *goat of traveling* can become a **Large goat** with the same statistics as a **riding horse**. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in beast form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can't be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all its charges.

* The *goat of travail* becomes a **giant goat** for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 30 days have passed.

* The *goat of terror* becomes a **giant goat** for up to 3 hours. The goat can't attack, but you can remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes a *+1 lance*, and the other becomes a *+2 longsword*. Removing a horn requires an action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form. In addition, the goat radiates a 30-foot-radius aura of terror while you are riding it. Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the goat for 1 minute, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it successfully saves against the effect, a creature is immune to the goat's aura for the net 24 hours. Once the figurine has been used, it can't be used again until 15 days have passed.

***Marble Elephant (Rare).*** This marble statuette is about 4 inches high and long. It can become an **elephant** for up to 24 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

***Obsidian Steed (Very Rare).*** This polished obsidian horse can become a **nightmare** for up to 24 hours. The nightmare fights only to defend itself. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 5 days have passed.

If you have a good alignment, the figurine has a 10 percent chance each time you use it to ignore your orders, including a command to revert to figurine form. If you mount the nightmare while it is ignoring your orders, you and the nightmare are instantly transported to a random location on the plane of Hades, where the nightmare reverts to figurine form.

***Onyx Dog (Rare).*** This onyx statuette of a dog can become a **mastiff** for up to 6 hours. The mastiff has an Intelligence of 8 and can speak Common. It also has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet and can see invisible creatures and objects within that range. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

***Serpentine Owl (Rare).*** This serpentine statuette of an owl can become a **giant owl** for up to 8 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed. The owl can telepathically communicate with you at any range if you and it are on the same plane of existence.

***Silver Raven (Uncommon).*** This silver statuette of a raven can become a **raven** for up to 12 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed. While in raven form, the figurine allows you to cast the [Animal Messenger](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:animal-messenger) spell on it at will.

In addition, the following *Figurine of Wondrous Power* was added in *Fizban's Treasury of Dragons:*

***Gold Canary (Legendary)***  
*Giant Canary Form.* The figurine becomes a giant canary (see the accompanying stat block) for up to 8 hours and can be ridden as a mount. Once the figurine has become a giant canary, it can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.  
*Gold Dragon Form.* While you are missing half or more of your hit points, you can speak a different command word and the figurine becomes an adult gold dragon for up to 1 hour. The dragon can’t use any legendary actions or lair actions. Once the figurine has become an adult gold dragon, it can’t be used this way again until 1 year has passed.

## Flail of Tiamat
Source: Fizban's Treasury of Dragons

*Weapon (flail), Legendary (Requires Attunement)*

This magic flail is made in the image of Tiamat, with five jagged heads shaped like the heads of five different chromatic dragons. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this flail. When you hit with an attack roll using it, the target takes an extra 5d4 damage of your choice of one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison.

While holding the flail, you can use an action and speak a command word to cause the heads to breathe multicolored flames in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 14d6 damage of one of the following damage types (your choice): acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage. Once this action is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

## Gloves of Soul Catching
Source: Candlekeep Mysteries

*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*

Your Constitution score is 20 while you wear these gloves. This property of the gloves has no effect on you if your Constitution is already 20 or higher.

After making a successful unarmed strike while wearing these gloves, you can use the gloves to deal an extra 2d10 force damage to the target, and you regain a number of hit points equal to the force damage dealt. Alternatively, instead of regaining hit points in this way, you can choose to gain advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw you make before the end of your next turn.

## Grimoire Infinitus
Source: Explorer's Guide to Wildemount

*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a wizard)*

Several of these spellbooks with gilded pages and silver-plated covers were created during the Age of Arcanum, but only one has been found since the Calamity ended. The book has an infinite number of pages, is three inches thick, eight inches wide, twelve inches long, and weighs three pounds.

***Dormant.*** Most of the book is blank, but the following spells are recorded in the first pages of the tome: [Alarm](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:alarm), [Antimagic Field](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:antimagic-field), [Bigby's Hand](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:bigbys-hand), [Blight](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:blight), [Charm Person](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:charm-person), [Confusion](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:confusion), [Control Weather](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:control-weather), [Create Undead](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:create-undead), [Detect Thoughts](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:detect-thoughts), [Enlarge/Reduce](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:enlarge-reduce), [Fear](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:fear), [Foresight](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:foresight), [Gaseous Form](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:gaseous-form), [Glyph of Warding](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:glyph-of-warding), [Legend Lore](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:legend-lore), [Leomund's Tiny Hut](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:leomunds-tiny-hut), [Mass Suggestion](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:mass-suggestion), [Mislead](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:mislead), [Misty Step](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:misty-step), [Mordenkainen's Faithful Hound](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:mordenkainens-faithful-hound), [Prismatic Spray](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:prismatic-spray), [Ray of Enfeeblement](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:ray-of-enfeeblement), [Silent Image](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:silent-image), [Teleport](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:teleport), and [Thunderwave](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:thunderwave).

You can use the grimoire as your spellbook, and you can scribe new spells into it as normal. When you prepare wizard spells using the grimoire, the number of wizard spells you can prepare increases by 1.

***Awakened.*** When the *Grimoire Infinitus* reaches an awakened state, it gains the following properties:

* While you carry the spellbook, you have advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects.
* When you prepare wizard spells using the grimoire as your spellbook, the number of spells you can prepare increases by 1 again.

***Exalted.*** When the *Grimoire Infinitus* reaches an exalted state, it gains the following properties:

* You can now use your Arcane Recovery feature twice between long rests, rather than once.
* When you prepare wizard spells using the grimoire as your spellbook, the number of spells you can prepare increases by 1 again.

## Gurt's Greataxe
Source: Storm King's Thunder

*Weapon (greataxe), legendary (requires attunement)*

In the Year of the Icy Axe (123 DR), the frost giant lord Gurt fell to Uthgar Gardolfsson-leader of the folk who would become the Uthgardt barbarians-in a battle that marked the ascendance of humankind over the giants in the Dessarin Valley. *Gurt's Greataxe* was buried in Morgur's Mound until it was unearthed and brought back to Waterdeep. After laying in the city's vaults for decades, the axe was given to Harshnag, a frost giant adventurer, in recognition of his service to Waterdeep. Uthgardt barbarians recognize the weapon on sight and attack any giant that wields it.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. It is sized for a giant, weighs 325 pounds, and deals 3d12 slashing damage on a hit, plus an extra 2d12 slashing damage if the target is human.

The axe sheds light as a torch when the temperature around it drops below 0 degrees Fahrenheit. The light can't be shut off in these conditions.

As an action, you can cast a version of the [Heat Metal](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:heat-metal) spell (save DC 13) that deals cold damage instead of fire damage. Once this power is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Hammer of Thunderbolts
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Weapon (maul), legendary*

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

**Giant's Bane (Requires Attunement).** You must be wearing a [Belt of Giant Strength](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:belt-of-giant-strength) (any variety) and [Gauntlets of Ogre Power](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:gauntlets-of-ogre-power) to attune to this weapon. The attunement ends if you take off either of those items. While you are attuned to this weapon and holding it, your Strength score increases by 4 and can exceed 20, but not 30. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon against a giant, the giant must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or die.

The hammer also has 5 charges. While attuned to it, you can expend 1 charge and make a ranged weapon attack with the hammer, hurling it as if it had the thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. If the attack hits, the hammer unleashes a thunderclap audible out to 300 feet. The target and every creature within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn. The hammer regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn.

## Hammock of Worlds
Source: Journeys through the Radiant Citadel

*Wondrous item, legendary*

The *Hammock of Worlds* is a colorful hammock woven with traditional Ataguan designs. It can be used only by a member of the order known as the Green Doctors.

You can use an action to unfold and place the *Hammock of Worlds* on a solid surface, whereupon it creates a two-way portal to the Ghost Orchid Tepui in the Feywild or to the Drought Elder in the Far Realm (the user's choice). You can use an action to close an open portal by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Once the *Hammock of Worlds* has opened a portal, it can't do so again for 1d8 hours.

## Harp of Gilded Plenty
Source: Bigby Presents - Glory of the Giants

*Wondrous Item, Legendary (Requires Attunement)*

This golden harp is sculpted in the image of the god Iallanis, depicted as a young cloud giant woman. When a creature comes within 5 feet of the harp, the instrument animates and is capable of speaking, singing, and playing by itself.

Whenever you attempt to attune to the harp, you must first make either a DC 15 Charisma (Performance) check or a DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince the harp that you are worthy, attuning to the harp on a success. If you fail, you can’t attempt to attune to the harp again until the next dawn. Once you have successfully attuned to the harp, the harp resizes to suit you.

**Stalwart Song.** Whenever you make a Charisma check while attuned to the harp, you can treat a roll of 9 or lower on the die as a 10.

**Feast of Plenty.** If you spend 10 minutes playing the harp, you can cast the [Heroes' Feast](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:heroes-feast) spell from it. Once this property is used, it can’t be used again until 1d10 + 10 days have passed.

**Soothing Melody.** As an action, you can use the harp to cast the [Calm Emotions](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:calm-emotions) spell (save DC 19). When the spell is cast using the harp, its duration increases to 1 hour, provided you maintain concentration on the spell. This property can be used five times, and it regains all uses at dawn.

***Sentience.*** The harp is a sentient, chaotic good object with an Intelligence of 13, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 20. It has hearing and *darkvision* to a range of 120 feet.

The harp can speak, read, and understand Common and Giant. It can also communicate telepathically with the creature attuned to it.

The harp has a dramatic and pompous personality, taking extreme pride in the quality of music produced from its strings. If the harp is shorter than 6 feet tall, it bemoans its height.

## Hazirawn
Source: Tyranny of Dragons

*Weapon (greatsword), legendary (requires attunement)*

A sentient (neutral evil) greatsword, Hazirawn is capable of speech in Common and Netherese. Even if you aren't attuned to the sword, you gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. If you aren't attuned to Hazirawn, you deal an extra 1d6 necrotic damage when you hit with it.

***Increased Potency.*** While you are attuned to this weapon, its bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls increases to +2, and a hit deals an extra 2d6 necrotic damage (instead of 1d6).

***Spells.*** Hazirawn has 4 charges to cast spells. As long as the sword is attuned to you and you are holding it in your hand, you can use an action to expend the required number of charges to cast one of the following spells from the sword: [Detect Magic](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:detect-magic) (1 charge), [Detect Evil and Good](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:detect-evil-and-good) (1 charge), or [Detect Thoughts](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:detect-thoughts) (2 charges). Each night at midnight, Hazirawn regains 1d4 expended charges.

***Wounding.*** While you are attuned to the weapon, any creature that you hit with Hazirawn can't regain hit points for 1 minute. The target can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending this effect early on itself on a success.

## Helm of Disjunction
Source: Dungeons and Dragons - Honor Among Thieves.

*Wondrous Item, legendary (requires attunement by a Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard)*

The wizard Mordenkainen crafted this sleek, golden helmet. If he created other helms of disjunction, they have yet to be found.

As an action while wearing this helm, you can use it to emit an antimagic pulse in a 300-foot-radius sphere centered on yourself. The pulse has the following effects:

**Magic Item Disjunction.** Potions and scrolls in the area are destroyed. All other magic items in the area have their magical properties suppressed for 1 minute. Artifacts are unaffected by this property, as are magic items on your person.

**Spell Disjunction.** Any ongoing spell ends if the creature, object, or area affected by it is even partly in the pulse’s area.

**Wave of Force.** The antimagic pulse is strong enough to knock down creatures close to you. Each creature within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or have the prone condition.

Once you use the helm’s property, it can’t be used again until 1d4 days have passed.

## Helm of the Scavenger
Wondrous Item (Attuned)
Source - Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage

*Wondrous Item, Legendary (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*

This ornate chair is designed to propel and maneuver a ship through space.

**Passive Properties.** The following properties of the helm come into play even when no creature is attuned to it:

* When placed aboard a vessel weighing between 1 and 100 tons, the helm generates an envelope of fresh air around the ship while it is in the void of space (but not underwater). This envelope extends out from the edges of the hull in all directions for a distance equal in length to the vessel's beam, so that creatures aboard or near the ship can breath normally in space. The temperature within the air envelope is 70 degrees Fahrenheit.
* When placed aboard a vessel weighing between 1 and 100 tons, the helm generates an artificial gravity field while the ship is in the void of space, so that creatures can walk on the ships decks as they normally would. Creatures and objects that fall overboard bob in a gravity plane that extends out from the main deck for a distance equal in length to the vessel's beam.

**Active Properties.** The sensation of being attuned to the helm is akin to being immersed in warm water. While attuned to the helm you gain the following abilities while you sit in it:

* You can use the helm to propel the vessel across or through water and other liquids at a maximum speed in miles per hour equal to your highest-level unexpended spell slot.
* You can use the helm to propel the vessel through air or space at a maximum speed in miles per hour equal to your highest-level unexpended spell slot x 10.
* Provided you have at least one unexpended spell slot, you can steer the vessel, albeit in a somewhat clumsy fashion, in much the same way that oars or a rudder can maneuver a seafaring ship.
* Whenever you like, you can see what's happening on and around the vessel as though you were standing in a location of your choice aboard it.

**Drawback.** While attuned to the helm, you cannot expend your own spell slots.

## Heretic
Source: Quests from the Infinite Staircase

*Weapon (longsword), legendary (requires attunement by a non-good creature)*

The blasphemous weapon Heretic was created by a cult to steal power from good-aligned gods. The blade hungers to strike down servants of the Upper Planes and weaken the forces of good.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Heretic has 6 charges for the following properties; the sword regains 1d4 + 1 charges daily at dawn:

**Destroy Devotion.** Once per turn when you hit a creature with this weapon, you can expend 1 of its charges to attempt to render the target powerless. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or have the paralyzed condition until the start of your next turn. Celestials have disadvantage on the save.

**Faith Hunter.** While holding the sword, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it: [Detect Evil and Good](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:detect-evil-and-good) (1 charge), [Fly](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:fly) (2 charges), or [True Seeing](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:true-seeing) (3 charges).

**Sentience.** Heretic is a sentient, chaotic evil weapon with an Intelligence of 17, a Wisdom of 17, and a Charisma of 15. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.  
The weapon can speak, read, and understand Common and Giant, and it can communicate with its wielder telepathically. Its voice is soft and deep but rises in a wild furor when it's aware Celestials or worshipers of good-aligned deities are present. While you are attuned to it, Heretic also understands every language you know.

**Personality.** Heretic craves the destruction of good-aligned gods and their supporters. The blade is condescending and snobby, especially in the company of priests and other pious folk, at whom it often directs sneering comments. When Heretic identifies its quarry, it erupts in a frenzied need for violence.

## Hide of the Feral Guardian
Source: Explorer's Guide to Wildemount

*Armor (studded leather), legendary (requires attunement)*

It is believed that this polished and beautifully detailed leather armor was a gift from Melara, bestowed on a long-forgotten archdruid and champion of the natural world before the terrors of the Calamity.

***Dormant.*** While wearing the armor in its dormant state, you gain the following benefits:

* The armor grants you a + 1 bonus to AC.
* While you are transformed by an effect that replaces any of your game statistics with those of another creature, you have a + 1 bonus to melee attack and damage rolls, and you retain the benefits of this armor.
* As an action, you can use the armor to cast [Polymorph](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:polymorph) on yourself, transforming into a **giant owl** while retaining your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.

***Awakened.*** When the armor reaches an awakened state, it gains the following properties:

* The AC bonus of the armor increases to +2.
* While you are transformed by an effect that replaces any of your game statistics with those of another creature, your bonus to melee attack and damage rolls increases by 1 (to +2).
* When you cast the [Polymorph](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:polymorph) spell using this armor, you can transform into a cave bear (use the **polar bear** statistics).

***Exalted.*** When the armor reaches an exalted state, it gains the following properties:

* The AC bonus of the armor increases to +3.
* While you are transformed by an effect that replaces any of your game statistics with those of another creature, your bonus to melee attack and damage rolls increases by 1 (to +3).
* When you cast the [Polymorph](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:polymorph) spell using this armor, you can transform into a **guardian wolf**.

## Hither-Thither Staff
Source: Dungeons and Dragons - Honor Among Thieves.

*Staff, legendary*

This walking stick has a brilliant gemstone fitted at the top. This staff has 4 charges and regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn.

As an action, you can expend 1 charge from the staff to create two linked teleportation portals, each one appearing on a flat surface of your choice that you can see within 1,500 feet of yourself. Alternatively, you can expend 1 charge as an action to relocate one or both portals, subject to the same limitation. The surface on which a portal appears must be big enough to accommodate it. Each portal is a two-dimensional, glowing oval ring, and together they create an open doorway up to 6 feet high and 4 feet wide. Any creature or object entering one portal exits from the other as if the two portals were a single opening that connects their locations.

A portal can appear on a moving surface, but the effect ends when the two portals move more than 1 mile apart. As a bonus action while holding the staff, you can close both portals (ending the effect) or suppress one portal, causing it to disappear until you relocate it (see above), during which time the remaining portal can’t be used. The portals otherwise last for 24 hours.

## Holy Avenger
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Weapon (any sword), legendary (requires attunement by a paladin)*

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit a fiend or an undead with it, that creature takes an extra 2d10 radiant damage.

While you hold the drawn sword, it creates an aura in a 10-foot radius around you. You and all creatures friendly to you in the aura have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. If you have 17 or more levels in the paladin class, the radius of the aura increases to 30 feet.

## Holy Symbol of Ravenkind
Source: Curse of Strahd

*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a cleric or paladin of good alignment)*

The *Holy Symbol of Ravenkind* is a unique holy symbol sacred to the good-hearted faithful of Barovia. It predates the establishment of any church in Barovia. According to legend, it was delivered to a paladin named Lugdana by a giant raven — or an angel in the form of a giant raven. Lugdana used the holy symbol to root out and destroy nests of vampires until her death. The high priests of Ravenloft kept and wore the holy symbol after Lugdana's passing.

The holy symbol is a platinum amulet shaped like the sun, with a large crystal embedded in its center. The holy symbol has 10 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d6 + 4 charges daily at dawn.

***Hold Vampires.*** As an action, you can expend 1 charge and present the holy symbol to make it flare with holy power. Vampires and vampire spawn within 30 feet of the holy symbol when it flares must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target is paralyzed for 1 minute. It can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns to end the effect on itself.

***Turn Undead.*** If you have the Turn Undead or the Turn the Unholy feature, you can expend 3 charges when you present the holy symbol while using that feature. When you do so, undead have disadvantage on their saving throws against the effect.

***Sunlight.*** As an action, you can expend 5 charges while presenting the holy symbol to make it shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The light is sunlight and lasts for 10 minutes or until you end the effect (no action required).

## Horn of Beckoning Death
Source: Dungeons and Dragons - Honor Among Thieves

*Wondrous Item, legendary (requires attunement by a Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard)*

Resembling a small dragon’s horn, this arcane device glows with a hellish internal light when held. As an action while holding this horn, you can invoke a necromantic effect called the Beckoning Death.

The Beckoning Death arrives at the start of your next turn and manifests as a crimson cloud of smoke that fills a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the horn. The sphere doesn’t move with the horn. At the start of each of your turns, the sphere’s radius increases by 30 feet. The cloud disappears after 10 minutes or when your concentration on the effect ends. Any creature (including you) that has 9 or fewer hit points when it ends its turn in the cloud is slain by the Beckoning Death. A Humanoid killed in this way instantly transforms into a zombie (see the Monster Manual). The zombie obeys the commands of the horn’s creator, the lich Szass Tam.

Once you use the horn’s property, it can’t be used again for 1 year.

## Horn of Valhalla
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, rare (silver or brass), very rare (bronze), or legendary (iron)*

You can use an action to blow this horn. In response, warrior spirits from the plane of Ysgard appear within 60 feet of you. These spirits use the berserker statistics from the *Monster Manual*. They return to Ysgard after 1 hour or when they drop to 0 hit points. Once you use the horn, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

Four types of *horn of Valhalla* are known to exist, each made of a different metal. The horn's type determines how many berserkers answer its summons, as well as the requirement for its use. The DM chooses the horn's type or determines it randomly.

|d100 |Horn Type|Berserkers Summoned|            Requirement             |
|-----|---------|-------------------|------------------------------------|
|01-40| Silver  |      2d4 + 2      |                None                |
|41-75|  Brass  |      3d4 + 3      |Proficiency with all simple weapons |
|76-90| Bronze  |      4d4 + 4      | Proficiency with all medium armor  |
|91-00|  Iron   |      5d4 + 5      |Proficiency with all martial weapons|

If you blow the horn without meeting its requirement, the summoned berserkers attack you. If you meet the requirement, they are friendly to you and your companions and follow your commands.

## Icon of Ravenloft
Source: Curse of Strahd

*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a creature of good alignment)*

The *Icon of Ravenloft* is a 12-inch-tall statuette made of the purest silver, weighing 10 pounds. It depicts a cleric kneeling in supplication.

The icon was given to Strahd by the archpriest Ciril Romulich, an old family friend, to consecrate the castle and its chapel.

While within 30 feet of the icon, a creature is under the effect of a [Protection from Evil and Good](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:protection-from-evil-and-good) spell against fiends and undead. Only a creature attuned to the icon can use its other properties.

***Augury.*** You can use an action to cast an [Augury](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:augury) spell from the icon, with no material components required. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.

***Bane of the Undead.*** You can use the icon as a holy symbol while using the Turn Undead or Turn the Unholy feature. If you do so, increase the save DC by 2.

***Cure Wounds.*** While holding the icon, you can take an action to heal one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. The target regains 3d8 + 3 hit points, unless it is an undead, a construct, or a fiend. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Infernal Tack
Source: Baldur's Gate - Descent into Avernus

*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a creature of evil alignment)*

A narzugon devil binds a nightmare (described in the *Monster Manual*) to its service with infernal tack, which consists of a bridle, bit, reins, saddle, stirrups, and spurs. A nightmare equipped with *infernal tack* must serve whoever wears the spurs until the wearer dies or the tack is removed.

You can use an action to call the nightmare equipped with *infernal tack* by clashing the spurs together or scraping them through blood. The nightmare appears at the start of your next turn, within 20 feet of you. It acts as your ally and takes its turn on your initiative count. It remains for 1 day, until you or it dies, or until you dismiss it as an action. If the nightmare dies, it reforms in the Nine Hells within 24 hours, after which you can summon it again.

The tack doesn't conjure a nightmare from thin air; one must first be subdued so the tack can be placed on it. No nightmare accepts this forced servitude willingly, but some eventually form strong loyalties to their masters and become partners in evil.

## Infiltrator's Key
Source: Explorer's Guide to Wildemount

*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*

This mithral skeleton key was forged using the blood of twelve master thieves executed for trying to steal magic items during the Age of Arcanum.

***Dormant.*** The *Infiltrator's Key* grants the following benefits in its dormant state:

* The key can be used as thieves' tools for the purpose of opening locks. When using the key, you are considered proficient in thieves' tools and you have advantage on ability checks made to open locks.
* While holding the key, your steps are muffled, giving you advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to move silently.

***Awakened.*** When the *Infiltrator's Key* reaches an awakened state, it gains the following properties:

* While holding the key, you can use a bonus action to transform the key into a magic dagger or back into a key. While the key is in the form of a dagger, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it, and it returns to your hand immediately after it is used to make a ranged attack.
* While holding the key, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it: [Alter Self](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:alter-self), [Invisibility](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:invisibility), [Knock](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:knock), or [Pass Without Trace](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:pass-without-trace). Once a spell has been cast using the key, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn.

***Exalted.*** When the *Infiltrator's Key* reaches an exalted state, it gains the following properties:

* As a bonus action, you can touch the key to a floor, wall, or ceiling that is no more than 5 feet thick and cause a magical opening to appear in the surface. When you create the opening, you choose its length and width, up to 10 feet for each dimension. The opening lasts until the key passes through it to the other side, at which point it disappears (if a creature is in the opening when the doorway closes, the creature is safely shunted to the nearest unoccupied space). The key can't be used to create another opening until the next dawn.
* While holding the key, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it: [Dimension Door](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:dimension-door), [Gaseous Form](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:gaseous-form), or [Mislead](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:mislead). Once a spell has been cast using the key, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn.

## Instrument of the Bards
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement by a bard)*

An *instrument of the bards* is an exquisite example of its kind, superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a legendary bard college. The following table lists the spells common to all instruments, as well as the spells specific to each one and its rarity. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 2d4 psychic damage.

You can use an action to play the instrument and cast one of its spells. Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.

You can play the instrument while casting a spell that causes any of its targets to be charmed on a failed saving throw, thereby imposing disadvantage on the save. This effect applies only if the spell has a somatic or a material component.

|     Instrument     | Rarity  |                                                                                                                                                     Spells                                                                                                                                                     |

## Ioun Stone
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide, Lost Laboratory of Kwalish

*Wondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement)*

An *Ioun stone* is named after Ioun, a god of knowledge and prophecy revered on some worlds. Many types of *Ioun stone* exist, each type a distant combination of shape and color.

When you use an action to toss one of these stones into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance of 1d3 feet and confers a benefit to you. Thereafter, another creature must use an action to grasp or net the stone to separate it from you, either by making a successful attack roll against AC 24 or a successful DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. You can use an action to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect.

A stone has AC 24, 10 hit points, and resistance to all damage. It is considered to be an object that is being worn while it orbits your head.

***Absorption (Very Rare).*** While this pale lavender ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell of 4th level or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you

Once the stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can't cancel it.

***Agility (Very Rare).*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this deep red sphere orbits your head.

***Awareness (Rare).*** You can't be surprised while this dark blue rhomboid orbits your head.

***Fortitude (Very Rare).*** Your Constitution score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pink rhomboid orbits your head.

***Greater Absorption (Legendary).*** While this marbled lavender and green ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell of 8th level or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you.

Once the stone has canceled 50 levels of spells, it burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can't cancel it.

***Insight (Very Rare).*** Your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this incandescent blue sphere orbits your head.

***Intellect (Very Rare).*** Your Intelligence score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled scarlet and blue sphere orbits your head.

***Leadership (Very Rare).*** Your charisma score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled pink and green sphere orbits your head.

***Mastery (Legendary).*** Your proficiency bonus increases by 1 while this pale green prism orbits your head.

***Protection (Rare).*** You gain a +1 bonus to AC while this dusty rose prism orbits your head.

***Regeneration (Legendary).*** You regain 15 hit points at the end of each hour this pearly white spindle orbits your head, provided that you have at least 1 hit point.

***Reserve (Rare).*** This vibrant purple prism stores spells cast into it, holding them until you use them. The stone can store up to 3 levels worth of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d4-1 levels of stored spells chosen by the DM.

Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 3rd level into the stone by touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the stone. If the stone can't hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.

While this stone orbits your head, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the stone is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.

***Strength (Very Rare).*** Your Strength score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pale blue rhomboid orbits your head.

***Sustenance (Rare).*** You don't need to eat or drink while this clear spindle orbits your head.

In addition, the following *Ioun Stones* were introduced in the adventure *Lost Laboratory of Kwalish*:

***Historical Knowledge (Rare)*** You gain proficiency in the History skill, or a +1 bonus to checks with that skill if already proficient, while this polished, steely sphere orbits your head.

***Language Knowledge (Rare)*** You are fluent in one additional language while this pulsating bit of red jeweled crystal orbits your head. The DM chooses the language bestowed by the stone.

***Natural Knowledge (Rare)*** You gain proficiency in the Nature skill, or a +1 bonus to checks with that skill if already proficient, while this burnished, brassy stone orbits your head.

***Religious Knowledge (Rare)*** You gain proficiency in the Religion skill, or a +1 bonus to checks with that skill if already proficient, while this tiny golden gem orbits your head.

***Self-Preservation (Rare)*** You gain a +1 bonus to Intelligence saving throws while this silvery gem orbits your head.

***Supreme Intellect (Rare)*** You gain a +1 bonus to Intelligence checks while this faceted sphere orbits your head.

## Iron Flask
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, legendary*

This iron bottle has a brass stopper. You can use an action to speak the flask's command word, targeting a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. If the target is native to a plane of existence other than the one you're on, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be trapped in the flask. If the target has been trapped by the flask before, it has advantage on the saving throw. Once trapped, a creature remains in the flask until released. The flask can hold only one creature at a time. A creature trapped in the flask doesn't need to breathe, eat, or drink and doesn't age.

You can use an action to remove the flask's stopper and release the creature the flask contains. The creature is friendly to you and your companions for 1 hour and obeys your commands for that duration. If you give no commands or give it a command that is likely to result in its death, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. At the end of the duration, the creature acts in accordance with its normal disposition and alignment.

An [Identify](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:identify) spell reveals that a creature is inside the flask, but the only way to determine the type of creature is to open the flask. A newly discovered bottle might already contain a creature chosen by the DM or determined randomly.

## Ironfang
Source: Princes of the Apocalypse

*Weapon (war pick), legendary (requires attunement)*

A war pick forged from a single piece of iron, *Ironfang* has a fang-like head inscribed with ancient runes. The pick is heavy in the hand, but when the wielder swings the pick in anger, the weapon seems almost weightless. This weapon is immune to any form of rust, acid, or corrosion — nothing seems to mark it. *Ironfang* contains a spark of Ogremoch, the Prince of Evil Earth.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls you make with this magic weapon. When you hit with it, the target takes an extra 1d8 thunder damage.

***Earth Mastery.*** You gain the following benefits while you hold *Ironfang*:

• You can speak Terran fluently.  
• You have resistance to acid damage.  
• You have tremorsense out to a range of 60 feet.  
• You can sense the presence of precious metals and stones within 60 feet of you, but not their exact location.  
• You can cast [Dominate Monster](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:dominate-monster) (save DC 17) on an earth elemental. Once you have done so, *Ironfang* can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.

***Shatter.*** *Ironfang* has 3 charges. You can use your action to expend 1 charge and cast the 2nd-level version of [Shatter](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:shatter) (DC 17). *Ironfang* regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.

***The Rumbling.*** While inside an earth node, you can perform a ritual called the Rumbling, using *Ironfang* to create a *devastation orb of earth* (see the [Devastation Orb](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:devastation-orb) description for the time and cost of the ritual). Once you perform the ritual, *Ironfang* can’t be used to perform the ritual again until the next dawn.

***Flaw.*** *Ironfang* heightens its wielder’s destructive nature. While attuned to the weapon, you gain the following flaw: “I like to break things and cause ruin.”

## Jester's Mask
Source: The Book of Many Things

*Wondrous Item, legendary (requires attunement by a Bard, Sorcerer, or Warlock)*

This colorful, harlequin domino mask is edged with pearls. While wearing this mask, you gain the following benefits:

**Charismatic Focus.** You can use the mask as a spellcasting focus. You gain a +3 bonus to any spell attack rolls and spell saving throw DCs that use Charisma as the spellcasting ability.

**Marvelous Escape.** When a creature hits you with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to disappear in a puff of smoke and colorful sparkles. You take no damage and instead teleport, along with anything you are wearing or carrying, to an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of yourself. Once this reaction is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

**Topsy-Turvy.** When you roll a 1 on a d20, you can treat the roll as if you rolled a 20 instead. Once this property is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

## Jewel of Three Prayers
Source: Critical Role - Call of the Netherdeep

*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*

The *Jewel of Three Prayers* is a Vestige of Divergence. In ancient times, Alyxian the Apotheon bore this amulet as a symbol of his covenant with three Prime Deities: Sehanine the Moon Weaver, Avandra the Change Bringer, and Corellon the Arch Heart. When the jewel is found, only Sehanine’s power thrums within its dormant heart. The power of the other two deities waits to be reawakened by a hero - or heroes - who can follow in Alyxian’s footsteps.

***Dormant State.*** In this state, the *Jewel of Three Prayers* is a glittering golden disk attached to a fine golden chain. The chain magically resizes to function as a necklace for the creature that wears it.

* In its Dormant State, the jewel has the following properties:
  * You gain a +1 bonus to AC while wearing the jewel.

On a failed save, the creature takes a 4d10 radiant damage and is blinded until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t blinded.

## Korolnor Scepter
Source: Storm King's Thunder

*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*

The *Korolnor Scepter* is one of ten Ruling Scepters of Shanatar, forged by the dwarven gods and given to the ruling houses of the ancient dwarven empire. The *Korolnor Scepter*'s location was unknown for the longest time until a storm giant queen, Neri, found it in a barnacle-covered shipwreck at the bottom of the Trackless Sea. The Ruling Scepters are all roughly the same size and shape, but their materials and properties vary.

The *Korolnor Scepter* is a tapered mithral rod as thick and long as a dwarf's forearm, with a small platinum knob at the bottom and a rounded disk adorned with a ring of seven tiny blue gems at the top.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this scepter, which can be wielded as a magic club.

You can use the properties of the [Wyrmskull Throne](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:wyrmskull-throne), as well as the properties of the scepter itself. The scepter has 10 charges, and it regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges at dawn. Its properties are as follows:

* If you are underground or underwater, you can use an action to expend 1 charge to determine the distance to the surface.
* As an action, you can expend 2 charges to cast the [Sending](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:sending) spell from the scepter.
* As an action, you can expend 3 charges to cast the [Teleport](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:teleport) spell from the scepter. If the destination is within 60 feet of the [Wyrmskull Throne](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:wyrmskull-throne), there is no chance of a teleport error or mishap occurring.

## Longbow of the Healing Hearth
Source: Bigby Presents - Glory of the Giants

*Weapon (Longbow), Legendary (Requires Attunement)*

This ivory longbow is inscribed with a prayer to the god Hiatea, the runes of which are entwined with gilded engravings of wheat stalks and deer antlers.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. If you load no ammunition in the weapon, it produces its own, automatically creating one magic arrow when you pull back the string. The arrow created by the bow vanishes the instant after it hits or misses a target.

The bow has 8 charges for the following properties, which you can use while wielding the bow. The bow regains 1d4 + 1 charges daily at dawn.

**Curative Arrow.** When you take the Attack action using the bow, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your attacks with a blazing arrow of curative magic, which automatically hits one creature you can see within 150 feet of you. The target can then immediately spend and roll one of its unspent Hit Dice and regain a number of hit points equal to the roll plus your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1). If the target has no unspent Hit Dice remaining, nothing happens. You can use a curative arrow only once per turn.

**Spellcasting.** While holding the bow, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it (save DC 18): [Create Food and Water](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:create-food-and-water) (1 charge), [Warding Bond](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:warding-bond) (2 charges), [Guardian of Faith](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:guardian-of-faith) (3 charges).

## Lost Crown of Besilmer
Source: Princes of the Apocalypse

*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*

This dwarven battle-helm consists of a sturdy open-faced steel helmet, decorated with a golden circlet above the brow from which seven small gold spikes project upward. You gain the following benefits while wearing the crown:

* You have resistance to psychic damage.
* You have advantage on saving throws against effects that would charm you.
* You can use a bonus action to inspire one creature you can see that is within 60 feet of you and that can see or hear you. Once before the end of your next turn, the inspired creature can roll a d6 and add the num­ber rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. This uses 1 charge from the crown. It has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.

## Luck Blade
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Weapon (any sword), legendary (requires attunement)*

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While the sword is on your person, you also gain a +1 bonus to saving throws.

**Luck.** If the sword is on your person, you can call on its luck (no action required) to reroll one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw you dislike. You must use the second roll. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.

**Wish.** The sword has 1d4- 1 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and cast the [Wish](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:wish) spell from it. This property can't be used again until the next dawn. The sword loses this property if it has no charges.

## Luxon Beacon
Source: Explorer's Guide to Wildemount

*Wondrous item, legendary*

This dodecahedron of faintly glowing crystal is heavier than it appears. A set of handles are affixed to its sides, and it pulsates and thrums when touched.

***Fragment of Possibility.*** A creature that touches the beacon and concentrates for 1 minute receives a Fragment of Possibility, which looks like a Tiny, grayish bead of energy that follows the creature around, staying within 1 foot of it at all times. The fragment lasts for 8 hours or until used. Once the beacon grants a Fragment of Possibility, it can't grant another until the next dawn. A creature with a Fragment of Possibility from a *Luxon Beacon* can't gain another Fragment of Possibility from any source.

When a creature with a Fragment of Possibility makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, it can expend its fragment to roll an additional d20 and choose which of the d20s to use. Alternatively, when an attack roll is made against the creature, it can expend its fragment to roll a d20 and choose which of the d20s to use, the one it rolled or the one the attacker rolled.

If the original d20 roll has advantage or disadvantage, the creature rolls its d20 after advantage or disadvantage has been applied to the original roll.

***Soul Snare.*** If a follower of the Luxon who has undergone a ritual of consecution dies within 100 miles of a *Luxon Beacon*, their soul is ensnared by it. This soul will be reincarnated within the body of a random humanoid baby developing within 100 miles of the beacon.

## Matalotok
Source: Baldur's Gate - Descent into Avernus

*Weapon (warhammer), legendary (requites attunement)*

*Matalotok*, the Frost Father, is an ancient hammer fashioned by Thyrm, the god of frost giants. The favored weapon of the demon lord Kostchtchie, *Matalotok* is frigid to the touch and wreathed in mist.

You are immune to cold damage while holding *Matalotok*. Whenever it deals damage to a creature, the hammer radiates a burst of intense cold in a 30-foot-radius sphere. Each creature in that area takes 10 (3d6) cold damage.

## Moonblade
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Weapon (longsword), legendary (requires attunement by an elf or half-elf of neutral good alignment)*

Of all the magic items created by the elves, one of the most prized and jealously guarded is a *moonblade*. In ancient times, nearly all elven noble houses claimed one such blade. Over the centuries, some blades have faded from the world, their magic lost as family lines have become extinct. Other blades have vanished with their bearers during great quests. Thus, only a few of these weapons remain.

A *moonblade* passes down from parent to child. The sword chooses its bearer and remains bonded to that person for life. If the bearer dies, another heir can claim the blade. If no worthy heir exists, the sword lies dormant. It functions like a normal longsword until a worthy soul finds it and lays claim to its power.

A *moonblade* serves only one master at a time. The attunement process requires a special ritual in the throne room of an elven regent or in a temple dedicated to the elven gods.

A *moonblade* won't serve anyone it regards as craven, erratic, corrupt, or at odds with preserving and protecting elvenkind. If the blade rejects you, you make ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws with disadvantage for 24 hours. If the blade accepts you, you become attuned to it and a new rune appears on the blade. You remain attuned to the weapon until you die or the weapon is destroyed.

A *moonblade* has one rune on its blade for each master it has served (typically 1d6 + 1). The first rune always grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Each rune beyond the first grants the *moonblade* an additional property. The DM chooses each property or determines it randomly on the Moonblade Properties table.

**Sentience.** A *moonblade* is a sentient neutral good weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 12. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon communicates by transmitting emotions, sending a tingling sensation through the wielder's hand when it wants to communicate something it has sensed. It can communicate more explicitly, through visions or dreams, when the wielder is either in a trance or asleep.

**Personality.** Every *moonblade* seeks the advancement of elvenkind and elven ideals. Courage, loyalty, beauty, music, and life are all part of this purpose.

The weapon is bonded to the family line it is meant to serve. Once it has bonded with an owner who shares its ideals, its loyalty is absolute.

If a *moonblade* has a flaw, it is overconfidence. Once it has decided on an owner, it believes that only that person should wield it, even if the owner falls short of elven ideals.

* At any time during your turn, the orb can cast the [Suggestion](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:suggestion) spell (save DC 17), targeting you or one other creature that touched the orb within the last 24 hours. This isn't a power of the orb that you control.

***Curse.*** Any Humanoid you touch while holding the orb must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or become cursed. Each creature cursed by the orb bears an echo of Murgaxor's hateful thoughts, and that creature suffers from headaches that are persistent but not debilitating until the curse ends. On your turn, the orb can use an action to produce one of the following effects, targeting one or more creatures it has cursed:

* **Unconsciousness.** The cursed creature falls unconscious for 1 hour. The creature is roused if it takes damage or someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake.

* **Visions of Terror.** The cursed creature sees terrifying visions, causing it to view all creatures that aren't also cursed as dangerous monsters for 10 minutes. The cursed creature must use its action each round to make one attack against the nearest non-cursed creature. If the cursed creature has multiple possible targets, it attacks one at random. This effect ends if the cursed creature is incapacitated.

After either of these effects ends, the affected creature is no longer cursed. The curse can also be removed from a creature with a [Remove Curse](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:remove-curse) spell or similar magic. All cases of the curse end if *Murgaxor's orb* is destroyed.

***Magical Signature.*** As a side effect of the orb's curse, the spell [Detect Magic](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:detect-magic) reveals an aura of enchantment surrounding creatures bearing the curse. This aura is distinctive, but in a way [Detect Magic](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:detect-magic) offers no further details about.

***Destroying the Orb.*** *Murgaxor's orb* has AC 18; 20 hit points; immunity to necrotic, poison, and psychic damage; and resistance to all other types of damage. If reduced to 0 hit points, the orb shatters.

## Nepenthe
Source: Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft

*Weapon (longsword), legendary (requires attunement by a paladin)*

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit a fiend or an undead with it, that creature takes an extra 2d10 radiant damage.

While you hold the drawn sword, it creates an aura in a 10-foot radius around you. You and all creatures friendly to you in the aura have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. If you have 17 or more levels in the paladin class, the radius of the aura increases to 30 feet.

**Sentience.** Nepenthe is a sentient neutral evil weapon with an Intelligence of 10, a Wisdom of 8, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. It can read and understand Elvish. It can also speak Elvish, but only through the voice of its wielder, with whom the sword can communicate telepathically.

**Personality.** In its lifetime, the sword has beheaded thousands of criminals, not all of whom were guilty of the crimes for which they were convicted. The sword cannot distinguish the guilty from the innocent. With each beheading, it hungers for more justice and blood. The sword is corrupt and irredeemable.

## Nether Scroll of Azumar
Source: Candlekeep Mysteries

*Scroll, legendary*

Unlike most scrolls, a Nether Scroll of Azumar is not a consumable magic item. It takes 30 days of concentrated study—at least 8 hours per day—to attempt to understand this scroll. After completing this study, you must make a DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check. If this check fails, you take 16d10 psychic damage, and you can attempt the check again after another 30 days of concentrated study.

When you succeed on the check, you gain the following benefits:

* Your Intelligence score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22. Once you gain this benefit, you can't use this scroll to increase your Intelligence again.
* You gain advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

When you gain the scroll's benefits, a stone golem magically appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of you and acts as your ally. If you die, the golem turns to dust.

## Nightbringer
Source: Monstrous Compendium Volume 2 - Dragonlance Creatures

*Weapon (Mace), Legendary (Requires Attunement)*

This heavy mace has a dark oaken handle and a head of blackened steel trimmed with gold. In combat, the mace’s head is wreathed in inky black energy.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. When you hit with an attack roll using it, the target takes an additional 4d4 radiant damage.

If you have an evil alignment, you also gain the following benefits when attuned to Nightbringer:

**Blessing of the Dragon Queen.** You are immune to the charmed and frightened conditions, and you gain immunity to one of the following damage types (choose when you attune to the weapon): acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison.

**Eyes of Midnight.** You have darkvision with a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, its range increases by 60 feet.

**Midnight Shroud.** The weapon has 6 charges. When you hit a creature with an attack using this weapon, you can expend one charge to force the creature to make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is blinded until the start of your next turn. The weapon regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.

## Nightfall Pearl
Source: Explorer's Guide to Wildemount

*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*

Used to summon night, this 6-inch-diameter, jet-black orb is cold to the touch. You can spend 10 minutes to activate it, causing the area within 10 miles of it at the moment of activation to become night even if it is daytime. This night lasts for 24 hours, until you cancel it as an action, or until your attunement to the pearl ends. Once used, the pearl can't be used again for 24 hours.

## Obsidian Flint Dragon Plate

*Armor (plate), legendary*

You gain a +2 bonus to AC and resistance to poison damage while you wear this armor. ln addition, you gain advantage on ability checks and saving throws made to avoid or end the grappled condition on yourself.

## Orb of Skoraeus
Source: Bigby Presents - Glory of the Giants

*Wondrous Item, Legendary (Requires Attunement by a Spellcaster)*

Said to be infused with the wisdom and power of the god Skoraeus, this polished stone orb is veined with iridescent crystal that seems to glow from within. The orb is 8 inches in diameter and weighs 8 pounds, making it a palm-sized trinket for a stone giant but a more unwieldy item for a Medium creature to use.

While holding this orb, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your spells. You also gain the following benefits:

**Abundant Components.** The orb has 3 charges and regains all expended charges at dawn. When you cast a spell while holding this orb, you can expend up to 3 charges to ignore the spell’s material components with a gold piece cost, up to 300 gp per charge expended.

**Astute Mind.** You gain a +2 bonus to any Constitution saving throw you make to maintain your concentration on a spell.

**Divine Sight.** You can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 120 feet.

## Orcsplitter
Source: Princes of the Apocalypse

*Weapon (greataxe), legendary (requires attunement by a good-aligned dwarf, fighter, or paladin)*

A mighty axe wielded long ago by the dwarf king Torhild Flametongue, *Orcsplitter* is a battered weapon that appears unremarkable at first glance. Its head is graven with the Dwarvish runes for “orc,” but the runes are depicted with a gap or slash through the markings; the word “orc” is literally split in two.

You gain the following benefits while holding this magic weapon:

* You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.
* When you roll a 20 on an attack roll with this weapon against an orc, that orc must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or drop to 0 hit points.
* You can’t be surprised by orcs while you’re not inca­pacitated. You are also aware when orcs are within 120 feet of you and aren’t behind total cover, although you don’t know their location.
* You and any of your friends within 30 feet of you can’t be frightened while you’re not incapacitated.

***Sentience.*** *Orcsplitter* is a sentient, lawful good weapon with an Intelligence of 6, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 10. It can see and hear out to 120 feet and has darkvision. It communicates by transmitting emotions to its wielder, although on rare occasions it uses a limited form of telepathy to bring to the wielder’s mind a couplet or stanza of ancient Dwarvish verse.

***Personality.*** *Orcsplitter* is grim, taciturn, and inflexible. It knows little more than the desire to face orcs in battle and serve a courageous, just wielder. It disdains cowards and any form of duplicity, deception, or disloyalty. The weapon’s purpose is to defend dwarves and to serve as a symbol of dwarven resolve. It hates the traditional foes of dwarves — giants, goblins, and, most of all, orcs — and silently urges its possessor to meet such creatures in battle.

## Plate Armor of Etherealness
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Armor (plate), legendary (requires attunement)*

While you're wearing this armor, you can speak its command word as an action to gain the effect of the [Etherealness](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:etherealness) spell, which last for 10 minutes or until you remove the armor or use an action to speak the command word again. This property of the armor can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Platinum Scarf
Source: Fizban's Treasury of Dragons

*Wondrous Item, Legendary (Requires Attunement)*

This scarf is made of sturdy cloth and covered in platinum-colored scales.  
As an action, you can pull a scale from the scarf and speak a command word. When you do so, choose one of the following effects:

**Breath of Life.** The scale disappears, and you or a creature you touch regains 10d4 hit points.

**Platinum Shield.** For 1 hour or until you dismiss it (no action required), the scale becomes a +1 shield, which you or another creature can use. A creature wielding the shield has immunity to radiant damage.

**Radiant Hammer.** For 1 hour or until you dismiss it (no action required), the scale becomes a magic light hammer, which you or another creature can use. The weapon deals 2d4 radiant damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for a light hammer. It deals an extra 2d4 radiant damage to chromatic dragons.

Once three scales have been pulled from the scarf, no more scales can be removed until the next dawn, when all the missing scales grow back. If you pull off a scale but don’t speak a command word, it disappears after 1 minute.

## Potion of Dragon's Majesty
Source: Fizban's Treasury of Dragons

*Potion, Legendary*

This potion looks like liquid gold, with a single scale from a chromatic, gem, or metallic dragon suspended in it. When you drink this potion, you transform into an adult dragon of the same kind as the dragon the scale came from. The transformation lasts for 1 hour. Any equipment you are wearing or carrying melds into your new form or falls to the ground (your choice). For the duration, you use the game statistics of the adult dragon instead of your own, but you retain your languages, personality, and memories. You can’t use a dragon’s Change Shape or its legendary or lair actions.

## Potion of Giant Size
Source: Storm King's Thunder

*Potion, legendary*

When you drink this potion, you become Huge for 24 hours if you are Medium or smaller, otherwise the potion does nothing. For that duration, your Strength becomes 25, if it isn't already higher, and your hit point maximum is doubled (your current hit points are doubled when you drink the potion). In addition, the reach of your melee attacks increases by 5 feet.

Everything you are carrying and wearing also increases in size for the duration. When rolling damage for weapons enlarged in this manner, roll three times the normal number of dice; for example, an enlarged longsword would deal 3d8 slashing damage (instead of 1d8), or 3d10 slashing damage (instead of 1d10) when used with two hands.

When the effect ends, any hit points you have above your hit point maximum become temporary hit points.

This potion is a pale white liquid made from the tongue of a giant clam, with a pungent aroma akin to that of rotting algae. It tastes sweet, however, when consumed.

## Potion of Giant Strength
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Potion, rarity varies*

When you drink this potion, your Strength score changes for 1 hour. The type of giant determines the score (see the table below). This potion has no effect on you if your Strength is equal to or greater than that score.

This potion's transparent liquid has floating in it a sliver of fingernail from a giant of the appropriate type. The *potion of frost giant strength* and the *potion of stone giant strength* have the same effect.

|  Type of Giant  |Strength| Rarity  |
|-----------------|--------|---------|
|   Hill Giant    |   21   |Uncommon |
|Frost/Stone Giant|   23   |  Rare   |
|   Fire Giant    |   25   |  Rare   |
|   Cloud Giant   |   27   |  Rare   |

## Powered Armor
Source: Lost Laboratory of Kwalish

*Armor (plate), legendary (requires attunement)*

*Powered Armor* resembles a suit of unusual plate armor, with finely articulated joints connected by an oily, black, leather-like material. The armor has been worked to create the appearance of a heavily muscled warrior, and its great helm is unusual in that it has no openings —- only a broad glass plate in the front with a second piece of glass above it. Strange plates, tubing, and large metal bosses adorn the armor in seemingly random fashion. On the back of the armor’s left gauntlet is a rectangular metal box, from which projects a short rod tipped with a cone-shaped red crystal.

While wearing this armor, you gain the following benefits:

* You have a +1 bonus to AC.
* Your Strength score is 18 (this has no effect if your Strength is already 18 or higher).
* You have advantage on death saving throws.

The armor has further capabilities that can be powered either by energy cells or by your own life energy. You can use a bonus action to draw power from an energy cell or sacrifice hit points to gain one of the following benefits:

* Emit a force field to gain 2d6 + 5 temporary hit points (1 charge or 5 hit points).
* Activate boosters to gain a flying speed of 15 feet for 1minute (1 charge or 5 hit points).
* Fire arm-mounted laser: *Ranged Weapon Attack*: +8 to hit, range 120 feet, one target. *Hit*: 2d6 radiant damage (1 charge or 5 hit points).
* Translate any writing you can see in any nonmagical language, to a total of one thousand words over 1 minute (1 charge or 5 hit points).
* Fill the armor with air, allowing you to breathe normally in any environment for up to 1 hour (1 charge or 5 hit points).
* Gain darkvision to a range of 60 feet for up to 1 hour (1 charge or 5 hit points).

The armor can accept only one energy cell at a time. It is found with one energy cell attached, containing 2d10 charges.

**Powered Armor Options**

Depending on where and how it appears in the adventure, you might wish to modify the features of Kwalish’s legendary *Powered Armor*.

***Automatic Defenses.*** Unless Kwalish deactivates the suit’s automatic defenses, no one can approach the armor without setting those defenses off. Treat the armor as a **shield guardian** that has stored a [Magic Missile](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:magic-missile) spell cast using a 4th-level spell slot. When the armor is reduced to 0 hit points, its defenses are rendered inert and it can be safely approached.

***Battle of Wills.*** When donned by a new user, the armor deems itself superior and attempts to take possession of that user. The user must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the armor. While possessed, the user is incapacitated and loses control of its body but retains its awareness. The armor uses the possessed user’s statistics (as adjusted by the armor), but doesn’t gain access to the user’s knowledge, features, or proficiencies.

Freeing a creature trapped inside the armor first requires defeating the armor’s automatic defenses (as above). The trapped creature can also attempt a DC 20 Charisma saving throw each day at dawn. On a successful save, the armor no longer controls the creature and can be safely donned by that creature at any time.

***Stasis.*** Whenever a creature wearing the armor drops to 0 hit points, the armor places that creature into a state of stasis. While in this state, the creature is stable and does not make death saving throws, but the armor takes control of the creature (as above). Additionally, the armor attempts to assume the identity of the user, assuring their allies that nothing is amiss. Freeing the user first requires defeating the armor’s automatic defenses (as above). A creature in stasis does not make Charisma saving throws to break the armor’s control.

***Alternative Power.*** *Powered Armor* originally required energy cells to fuel it, but was adapted by Kwalish to be fueled by the life energy of the creature wearing it. You might decide that the armor can also draw power from additional sources, or that energy cells can be recharged with the aid of a tinker, inventor, or artificer. It might also be possible for allies to connect to the armor through the use of magic that generates a conduit something like an astral silver cord. While so connected, a willing ally can give up hit points as a reaction to fuel the armor’s abilities.

## Prehistoric Figurines of Wondrous Power
Source: Bigby Presents - Glory of the Giants

*Wondrous Item, Varies*

Larger and more roughly hewn than typical figurines of wondrous power, these statuettes depict dinosaurs and related creatures from the earliest days of the world.

As an action, you can throw a prehistoric figurine of wondrous power to a point on the ground within 60 feet of yourself while speaking a command word, whereupon the figurine magically transforms into a living creature. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn’t enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn’t become a creature.

The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions. See the *Monster Manual* for the creature’s statistics.

The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its statuette form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can’t be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine’s description.

**Carnelian Triceratops (Very Rare).** This figurine becomes a triceratops for up to 6 hours and can be ridden as a mount. Once it has been used, it can’t be used again until 10 days have passed.

**Jasper Tyrannosaurus Rex (Legendary).** This figurine, crafted from rare green jasper, becomes a tyrannosaurus rex for up to 1 hour. Once it has been used, it can’t be used again until 14 days have passed.

Whenever you command the figurine while it’s in tyrannosaurus rex form (including commanding it to revert to figurine form), you must roll a d20. On a 1, you lose control of the figurine, and it becomes hostile to you and your companions until it is reduced to 0 hit points, at which point it reverts to figurine form.

**Kyanite Pteranodon (Rare).** This figurine becomes a pteranodon for up to 8 hours. If your size is Medium or smaller, you can ride the pteranodon as a mount. Once it has been used, it can’t be used again until 7 days have passed.

**Pyrite Plesiosaurus (Uncommon).** This figurine becomes a plesiosaurus for up to 12 hours and can be ridden as a mount. Once it has been used, it can’t be used again until 4 days have passed.

While you are riding the plesiosaurus, you can use it to cast [Water Breathing](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:water-breathing) at will.

## Pyxis of Pandemonium
Source: Mythic Odysseys of Theros

*Wondrous item, legendary*

A creature that touches this ornate wooden vessel for 1 minute gains the benefits of a short rest. That creature also gains the effects of the bless spell until the creature finishes a short or long rest. The creature can't gain these benefits again until it finishes a long rest.

If the vessel is opened, roll on the Pyxis of Pandemonium table to determine what happens. Any spells cast by the vessel have a spell save DC of 17. One minute after the vessel is opened, it disappears. It reappears, sealed, in a random location on the same plane of existence 24 hours later.

***Curse.*** Any creature that gains the benefit of a short rest from the vessel hears cloying telepathic whispers emanating it. That creature must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is charmed by the vessel for 1 hour. The charmed creature does everything it can to open the vessel as soon as possible. On a successful save, the creature is immune to the vessel's whispers for 24 hours.

|Pyxis of Pandemonium|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Its blade is cruelly serrated, and its hilt resembles a demonic head and wings. Whenever you slay a creature with an attack using the dagger, the creature's soul is imprisoned inside the dagger, and that creature can be restored to life only by a [Wish](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:wish) spell. The dagger can hold a maximum of five souls.

For each soul imprisoned in the dagger, your attacks with it deal an extra 1d4 necrotic damage on a hit. While the dagger is within 5 feet of you, your dreams are haunted by whispers from the trapped souls.

The dagger has the following additional properties.

***Siphon Vitality.*** As a bonus action, you can release any number of stored souls from the dagger to regain 1d10 hit points per soul released.

***Annihilation.*** If the dagger holds five souls, you can use this property: As a reaction immediately after you hit a creature with the dagger and deal damage to that target, you can release all five souls. If the target now has fewer than 75 hit points, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or die. If the target dies, you can't use this property again until you finish a long rest.

Each creature of your choice within 60 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the stunned condition until the start of your next turn.

Once the rune has been invoked, it can’t be invoked again until the next dawn.

While summoned, the djinni is friendly to you and your companions. It obeys any commands you give it, no matter what language you use. If you fail to command it, the djinni defends itself against attackers but takes no other actions.

## Rod of Lordly Might
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Rod, legendary (requires attunement)*

This rod has a flanged head, and it functions as a magic mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The rod has properties associated with six different buttons that are set in a row along the haft. It has three other properties as well, detailed below.

***Six Buttons.*** You can press one of the rod's six buttons as a bonus action. A button's effect lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to its normal form.

If you press **button 1**, the rod becomes a [Flame Tongue](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:flame-tongue) as a fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod's flanged head (you choose the type of sword).

If you press **button 2**, the rod's flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

If you press **button 3**, the rod's flanged head folds down, a spear point springs from the rod's tip, and the rod's handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic spear that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

If you press **button 4**, the rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long, as you specify. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its normal form.

If you press **button 5**, the rod transforms into a handheld battering ram and grants you a +10 bonus to Strength checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers.

If you press **button 6**, the rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the rod is used in a location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also gives you knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the ground or your height above it.

***Drain Life.*** When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target rakes an extra 4d6 necrotic damage, and you regain a number of hit points equal to half that necrotic damage. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.

***Paralyze.*** When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On a failure , the target is paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.

***Terrify.*** While holding the rod, you can use an action to force each creature you can see with in 30 feet of you to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a target is frightened of you for 1 minute. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Rod of Resurrection
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Rod, legendary (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or paladin)*

This rod has 5 charges. While you hold it, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it: [Heal](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:heal) (expends 1 charge) or [Resurrection](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:resurrection) (expends 5 charges.

## Ruby Weave Gem
Source: Fizban's Treasury of Dragons

*Wondrous Item, Legendary (Requires Attunement by a Spellcaster)*

The gem has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. When you cast a spell while holding this gem, you can expend up to 3 charges to ignore the spell’s material components with a gold piece cost, up to 500 gp per charge expended.

When you finish a long rest, choose a spell from any class list. The spell you choose must be of a level you can cast. You know the chosen spell and can cast it with your spell slots of the appropriate level until the end of your next long rest.

## Ruinblade
Source: Infernal Machine Rebuild

*Weapon (greatsword), legendary (requires attunement)*

*Ruinblade* is a unique weapon possessed by Moghadam, the architect of the Tomb of Horrors. A symbol of his authority, Moghadam carries the weapon during the time frame of the adventure to intimidate the tomb’s workers. (In later years, after Acererak trapped Moghadam in the completed tomb as an undead archwraith, Moghadam was able to use the weapon as his own phylactery.)

A small jade version of the green devil face of the Tomb of Horrors is fashioned into the hilt of the weapon, with the blade extending from its open mouth. The blade always appears ruined and rusting, and causes its surroundings to appear reflected in the blade as if in a state of decay.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit an undead creature with it, the attack deals an extra 1d8 force damage.

In addition, the weapon has the following properties:

***Blighted Ruin.*** You can cast the [Blight](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:blight) spell from the weapon (DC 15). Once used, this property of the weapon can’t be used until the next dawn.

***Destructive Ruin.*** You can cast the [Disintegrate](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:disintegrate) spell from the weapon, but can target only a nonmagical object or a creation of magical force. Once used, this property of the weapon can’t be used until dawn seven days later.

***Curse.*** This weapon is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. Until the curse is broken with a [Remove Curse](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:remove-curse) spell or similar magic, you are unwilling to part with the weapon.

The weapon must take direct part in the destruction of 1,000 gp worth of materials and objects every seven days, or a conflict arises between you and the weapon at the end of the seventh day.

***Sentience.*** *Ruinblade* is a sentient lawful evil weapon with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 8, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon can speak, read, and understand Common, and can communicate with its wielder telepathically. Its voice is a rough, ruined echo. While you are attuned to it, *Ruinblade* also understands every language you know.

***Personality.*** *Ruinblade* speaks either with a dolorous or frenetic tone, depending on its mood. That mood improves when the sword is actively engaged in acts of destruction, but worsens if the blade is left inactive too long.

The weapon’s purpose is to ruin and unmake existing objects, so that its owner can rebuild the world from a blank slate. It thus encourages its wielder to engage in constant destruction, claiming that this will allow the creation of a more superior vision from the ruin of what came before.

## Scaled Ornament
Source: Fizban's Treasury of Dragons

*Wondrous Item, Rarity Varies (Requires Attunement)*

This ornament can be jewelry, a cloak, or another wearable accessory. It appears to be fashioned from a dragon’s scale, tooth, or claw, or it incorporates images in those shapes.

**Slumbering (Uncommon).** You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid being charmed or frightened or to end those conditions on you.

**Stirring (Rare).** You gain a +1 bonus to AC, and you can’t be charmed or frightened. Moreover, each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you has advantage on saving throws it makes to avoid being charmed or frightened or to end those conditions on itself.

**Wakened (Very Rare).** The Wakened ornament has the Stirring property. In addition, when you would take damage of the type dealt by the breath of the dragon in whose hoard the ornament became Wakened, you can use your reaction to take no damage instead, and you regain hit points equal to the damage you would have taken. Once this property is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

**Ascendant (Legendary).** The Ascendant ornament has the Stirring and Wakened properties. In addition, while you are wearing the ornament, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover. While you are flying using this speed, spectral dragon wings appear on your back.

## Scarab of Protection
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*

If you hold this beetle-shaped medallion in your hand for 1 round, an inscription appears on its surface revealing its magical nature. It provides two benefits while it is on your person:

* You have advantage on saving throws against spells.
* The scarab has 12 charges. If you fail a saving throw against a necromancy spell or a harmful effect originating from an undead creature, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge and turn the failed save into a successful one. The scarab crumbles into powder and is destroyed when its last charge is expended.

## Scroll of Tarrasque Summoning
Source: Icewind Dale - Rime of the Frostmaiden

*Scroll, legendary*

Using an action to read the scroll causes the tarrasque (see the creature's entry in the *Monster Manual*) to appear in an unoccupied space you can see within 1 mile of you. The tarrasque disappears when it drops to 0 hit points and is hostile toward all creatures other than itself.

## Scroll of the Comet
Source: Icewind Dale - Rime of the Frostmaiden

*Scroll, legendary*

By using an action to read the scroll, you cause a comet to fall from the sky and crash to the ground at a point you can see up to 1 mile away from you. You must be outdoors when you use the scroll, or nothing happens and the scroll is wasted.

The comet creates a 50-foot-deep, 500-foot-radius crater on impact. Any creature in that radius must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 30d10 force damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one. All structures in the crater are destroyed, as are all nonmagical objects that aren't being worn or held.

## Shard Solitaire
Source: Keys from the Golden Vault

*Wondrous Item, Legendary (Requires Attunement)*

This gemstone contains an unstable extradimensional rift. Its facets are ribboned with iridescent veins that seem to move of their own accord. Five types of *shard solitaire* are known to exist, each one a different type of gemstone, as shown in the Shard Solitaire Types table.

***Rift Step.*** As a bonus action, while wearing or holding the *shard solitaire*, you can teleport yourself, along with anything you're wearing or carrying, to an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of yourself.

When you use this property, you can tap into the unstable power of the stone's extradimensional rift to increase the teleport distance by up to 30 feet, but if you teleport more than 30 feet using Rift Step, you must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 3d10 force damage immediately after you teleport.

***Spellcasting.*** The stone has 6 charges and regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn. The Shard Solitaire Types table lists the spells common to all *shard solitaires*, as well as the spells specific to each kind of stone. As an action, you can cast one of the stone's spells by expending the requisite number of charges, requiring no material components (save DC 16).

## Shield of the Blazing Dreadnought
Source: Bigby Presents - Glory of the Giants

*Armor (Shield), Legendary (Requires Attunement)*

Modeled after the formidable spiked tower shields wielded by some fire giants, this iron shield emanates a constant warmth.

You can use a bonus action to activate the shield, causing glowing lava to flow through the shield’s grooves for 1 minute. While the shield is active, you gain the following benefits:

**Blazing Soul.** You have immunity to fire damage.

**Cleansing Fire.** As an action, you can cause the shield to flare with the cleansing fire of the god Surtur. Choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself (you can choose yourself). One disease or condition of your choice affecting this creature ends immediately; the condition can be blinded, charmed, deafened, or poisoned.

**Shield Bash.** When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with a shield bash, targeting one creature you can see within 5 feet of yourself. The target must make a Strength saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier). On a failed save, the target takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage plus 3d6 fire damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only. You can use Shield Bash only once per turn.

Once the shield has been activated, it can’t be activated again until the next dawn.

## Shield of the Hidden Lord
Source: Baldur's Gate - Descent into Avernus

*Armor (shield), legendary (requires attunement)*

The *Shield of the Hidden Lord* is of celestial origin and serves as a prison for the pit fiend Gargauth, whose mortal followers revere it as a god. Over time, Gargauth's evil has warped the shield's appearance, so that its celestial motif and designs have become twisted into a fiendish face that subtly moves in disturbing ways.

While holding this shield, you gain a +2 bonus to AC and resistance to fire damage.

***Sentience.*** The *Shield of the Hidden Lord* is sentient as long as it imprisons Gargauth. While sentient, the shield has the following properties:

* The shield has an Intelligence of 22, a Wisdom of 18, and a Charisma of 24, as well as hearing and truesight out to a range of 120 feet.
* The shield can speak, read, and understand Common and Infernal, and it can communicate telepathically with any creature it can sense within 120 feet of it. Its voice is a deep, hollow whisper.
* The shield has 3 charges. You can use an action to expend 1 charge to cast [Fireball](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:fireball) or 2 charges to cast [Wall of Fire](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:wall-of-fire) from the shield (save DC 21 for each). The wall of fire spell lasts for 1 minute (no concentration required). The shield regains all expended charges daily at dawn.
* Anytime during your turn, the shield can choose to radiate an aura of dread for 1 minute. (This is not a power of the shield that you control.) Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn within 20 feet of the shield must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this power of the shield for the next 24 hours. Once the shield uses this power, it can't use it again until the next dawn.

***Gargauth's Personality.*** Gargauth desperately seeks freedom but can't escape on its own. The pit fiend won't reveal its true nature, referring to itself only as the Hidden Lord. It drops hints and subtle suggestions that it is an angel trapped in an unholy prison. If released from the shield, the pit fiend honors the terms of whatever bargain it struck to facilitate its escape.

While trapped in the shield, Gargauth carefully steers the shield's current owner toward committing acts of cruelty and domination, hoping to condemn the individual's soul to the Nine Hells. Conflict occurs if the shield's owner does anything that would make it more difficult for Gargauth to escape its prison, such as leaving the shield in a place where others are unlikely to find it.

Gargauth doesn't know how to escape from the shield. The pit fiend believes (incorrectly) that it can break free of the shield if it's brought to the Nine Hells, for it's convinced that the shield's powers are weaker there.

***Freeing Gargauth.*** Casting [Dispel Evil and Good](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:dispel-evil-and-good) on the shield has a 1 percent chance of freeing the pit fiend, or automatically succeeds if the spell is cast by a solar, a planetar, or an archdevil. A god can release the pit fiend by touching the shield and speaking Gargauth's name. When released, Gargauth appears in a random, unoccupied space as close to the shield as possible.

## Snicker-Snack
Source: The Wild Beyond The Witchlight

*Weapon (Greatsword), Legendary (Requires Attunement by a Non-evil Creature)*

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic vorpal sword. In addition, the weapon ignores resistance to slashing damage.

When you use this weapon to attack a creature that has at least one head and roll a 20 on the attack roll, you cut off one of the creature's heads. The creature dies if it can't survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, it doesn't have or need a head, it has legendary actions, or the DM decides that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra 6d8 slashing damage from the hit.

While attuned to *Snicker-Snack*, you have proficiency with greatswords, and you can use your Charisma modifier instead of your Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls made with the weapon.

**Sentience.** *Snicker-Snack* is a sentient, chaotic good greatsword with an Intelligence of 9, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. It can speak, read, and understand Common, and its voice sounds silvery and melodic. *Snicker-Snack* craves the destruction of evil Dragons and urges you to seek out these creatures and slay them.

*Snicker-Snack* has a fickle personality. It ends its attunement to you if you miss on attack rolls with the weapon three times in a row. Each time you finish a long rest after that happens, you can attempt to regain the sword's trust by making a contested Charisma check against *Snicker-Snack*. If you win the contest, your attunement to the weapon is instantly restored. Your attunement to the weapon can't be restored in any other way.

## Sovereign Glue
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, legendary*

This viscous, milky-white substance can form a permanent adhesive bond between any two objects. It must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated inside with [Oil of Slipperiness](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:oil-of-slipperiness). When found, a container contains 1d6 + 1 ounces.

One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square surface. The glue takes 1 minute to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the application of [Universal Solvent](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:universal-solvent) or [Oil of Etherealness](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:oil-of-etherealness), or with a [Wish](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:wish) spell.

## Spell Bottle
Source: Explorer's Guide to Wildemount

*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*

This glass bottle can store one spell of up to 5th level at a time. When found, roll a d6 and subtract 1: the total determines the level of spell in the bottle (the DM chooses the spell, and 0 means the bottle is empty). A swirling blue vapor fills the bottle while it contains a spell.

When the bottle is empty, any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 5th level into it by touching it while casting. The spell has no effect other than to be stored in the bottle.

While holding the bottle, you can cast the spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The bottle becomes empty once the spell is cast.

If you're holding the empty bottle when you see a creature casting a spell within 60 feet of you, you can open the bottle as a reaction in an attempt to interrupt the spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell has no effect, and it is stored in the bottle. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an Intelligence check. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a success, the spell has no effect, and it is stored in the bottle.

## Spell Gem
Source: Out of the Abyss

*Wondrous item, rarity varies (attunement optional)*

A *spell gem* can contain one spell from any class's spell list. You become aware of the spell when you learn the gems properties. While holding the gem. you can cast the spell from it as an action if you know the spell or if the spell is on your class spell list. Doing so doesn‘t require any components and doesn't require attunement. The spell then disappears from the gem.

If the spell is of a higher level than you can normally cast. you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a failed check. the spell disappears from the gem with no other effect.

Each *spell gem* has a maximum level for the spell it can store. The spell level determines the gems rarity and the stored spell's saving throw DC and attack bonus. as shown in the Spell Gem table.

You can imbue the gem with a spell if you're attuned to it and it's empty. To do so, you cast the spell while holding the gem. The spell is stored in the gem instead of having any effect. Casting the spell must require either 1 action or 1 minute or longer, and the spell's level must be no higher than the gem's maximum. If the spell belongs to the school of abjuration and requires material components that are consumed. you must provide them. but they can be worth half as much as normal.

Once imbued with a spell. the gem can't be imbued again until the next dawn.

Deep gnomes created these magic gemstones and keep the creation process a secret.

## Spell Scroll
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Scroll, rarity varies*

A *spell scroll* bears the words of a single spell, written in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class’s spell list, you can read the scroll and cast its spell without providing any material components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible. Casting the spell by reading the scroll requires the spell’s normal casting time. Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and it crumbles to dust. If the casting is interrupted, the scroll is not lost.

If the spell is on your class's spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect.

Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and the scroll itself crumbles to dust.

The level of the spell on the scroll determines the spell's saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as the scroll's rarity, as shown in the Spell Scroll table.

|Spell Scroll|         |       |            |

A wizard spell on a *spell scroll* can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When a spell is copied from a *spell scroll*, the copier must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the *spell scroll* is destroyed.

## Sphere Of Annihilation
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, legendary*

This 2-foot-diameter black sphere is a hole in the multiverse, hovering in space and stabilized by a magical field surrounding it.

The sphere obliterates all matter it passes through and all matter that passes through it. Artifacts are the exception. Unless an artifact is susceptible to damage from a *sphere of annihilation*, it passes through the sphere unscathed. Anything else that touches the sphere but isn't wholly engulfed and obliterated by it takes 4d10 force damage.

The sphere is stationary until someone controls it. If you are within 60 feet of an uncontrolled sphere, you can use an action to make a DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a success, the sphere levitates in one direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 5 x your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). On a failure, the sphere moves 10 feet toward you. A creature whose space the sphere enters must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be touched by it, taking 4d10 force damage.

If you attempt to control a sphere that is under another creature's control, you make an Intelligence (Arcana) check contested by the other creature's Intelligence (Arcana) check. The winner of the contest gains control of the sphere and can levitate it as normal.

If the sphere comes into contact with a planar portal, such as that created by the [Gate](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:gate) spell, or an extradimensional space, such as that within a [Portable Hole](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:portable-hole), the DM determines randomly what happens, using the following table.

|d100 |                                                              Result                                                              |

|01-50|                                                     The sphere is destroyed.                                                     |
|51-85|                             The sphere moves through the portal or into the extradimensional space.                              |
|86-00|A spatial rift sends each creature and object within 180 feet of the sphere, including the sphere, to a random plane of existence.|

## Spindle Of Fate
Source: The Book of Many Things

*Wand, legendary (requires attunement)*

This wand is shaped like a drop spindle wrapped in red thread. The wand has 6 charges that can be used for the following properties:

**Battle Foreknowledge.** When you roll initiative, you can expend 1 charge to add or subtract your proficiency bonus from the total roll.

**Doom Foretold.** As an action, you can expend 2 charges to target a creature within 30 feet of yourself and invoke that creature’s doom. While the target is on the same plane of existence as you, you can sense the direction to its location, and you know the direction of its movement if it’s in motion. Additionally, once per turn when you deal damage to the doomed creature, you can roll 1d6 and add the number rolled to the damage roll. These benefits persist for 1 hour or until you target another creature with this effect.

**Twist of Fate.** When a creature within 60 feet of you makes a saving throw or an attack roll, you can use your reaction to expend 3 charges and alter the outcome, turning a failed saving throw into a successful one, a missed attack roll into a hit, or vice versa.

The wand regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.

## Staff of the Magi
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Staff, legendary (requires attunement by a sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*

This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls.

The staff has 50 charges for the following properties. The staff regains 4d6 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 20, the staff regains 1d12 + 1 charges.

**Spell Absorption.** While holding the staff, you have advantage on saving throws against spells. In addition, you can use your reaction when another creature casts a spell that targets only you. If you do, the staff absorbs the magic of the spell, canceling its effect and gaining a number of charges equal to the absorbed spell's level. However, if doing so brings the staff's total number of charges above 50, the staff explodes as if you activated its retributive strike (see below).

**Spells.** While holding this staff, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: [Conjure Elemental](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:conjure-elemental) (7 charges), [Dispel Magic](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:dispel-magic) (3 charges), [Fireball](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:fireball) (7th-level version, 7 charges), [Flaming Sphere](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:flaming-sphere) (2 charges), [Ice Storm](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:ice-storm) (4 charges), [Invisibility](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:invisibility) (2 charges), [Knock](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:knock) (2 charges), [Lightning Bolt](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:lightning-bolt) (7th-level version, 7 charges), [Passwall](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:passwall) (5 charges), [Plane Shift](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:plane-shift) (7 charges), [Telekinesis](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:telekinesis) (5 charges), [Wall of Fire](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:wall-of-fire) (4 charges), or [Web](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:web) (2 charges).

You can also use an action to cast one of the following spells from the staff without using any charges: [Arcane Lock](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:arcane-lock), [Detect Magic](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:detect-magic), [Enlarge/Reduce](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:enlarge-reduce), [Light](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:light), [Mage Hand](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:mage-hand), or [Protection from Evil and Good](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:protection-from-evil-and-good).

**Retributive Strike.** You can use an action to break the staff over your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it.

You have a 50 percent chance to instantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you take force damage equal to 16 x the number of charges in the staff. Every other creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes an amount of damage based on how far away it is from the point of origin, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.

|**Distance from Origin**|              **Damage**              |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 10 ft. away or closer  |8 x the number of charges in the staff|
|   11 to 20 ft. away    |6 x the number of charges in the staff|
|   21 to 30 ft. away    |4 x the number of charges in the staff|

## Stonebreaker's Breastplate
Source: Bigby Presents - Glory of the Giants

*Armor (Breastplate), Legendary (Requires Attunement)*

This breastplate is made from marbled granite, though it feels no heavier than a typical metal breastplate. Its chest is emblazoned with the stone rune.

While wearing this breastplate, you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage and are immune to being knocked prone.

**Invoking the Rune.** As an action, you can invoke the breastplate’s rune to cast the [Wall of Stone](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:wall-of-stone) spell (save DC 14) with it. When you cast the spell in this way, you have advantage on saving throws made to maintain concentration on the spell.

Once the rune has been invoked, it can’t be invoked again until the next dawn.

## Stormgirdle
Source: Explorer's Guide to Wildemount

*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*

A *Stormgirdle* is a wide belt made of thick leather branded with the symbol of Kord. The girdle's clasps are made from dragon ivory.

***Dormant.*** While wearing the *Stormgirdle* in its dormant state, you have resistance to lightning damage and thunder damage, and your Strength score becomes 21 if it isn't already 21 or higher. In addition, you can use an action to become a Storm Avatar for 1 minute, gaining the following benefits for the duration:

Once you use the girdle's Storm Avatar property, that property can't be used again until the next dawn.

***Awakened.*** While wearing the *Stormgirdle* in its awakened state, you gain the following benefits:

* Your Strength score becomes 23 if it isn't already 23 or higher.
* Your Storm Avatar's lightning strike deals 4d6 lightning damage (instead of 3d6).
* While transformed into a Storm Avatar, you gain a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover.

## Sunsword
Source: Curse of Strahd

*Weapon (longsword), legendary (requires attunement)*

The *Sunsword* is a unique blade once possessed by Strahd's brother, Sergei von Zarovich. In its original form, it had a platinum hilt and guard, and a thin crystal blade as strong as steel.

Strahd employed a powerful wizard named Khazan to destroy the weapon after Sergei's death. The first part of the process required the hilt and the blade to be separated, which Khazan accomplished. While Khazan was busying himself destroying the blade, his apprentice stole the hilt and fled. Khazan later located his apprentice's mutilated corpse in the Svalich Woods, but the hilt was nowhere to be found. To avoid the vampire's wrath, Khazan told Strahd that the entire weapon had been destroyed.

The hilt, which is sentient, knows that it can never be reunited with its original crystal blade. It has, however, gained the properties of a [Sun Blade](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:sun-blade).

***Sentience.*** The *Sunsword* is a sentient chaotic good weapon with an Intelligence of 11, a Wisdom of 17, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 60 feet. The weapon communicates by transmitting emotions to the creature carrying or wielding it.

***Personality.*** The *Sunsword*'s special purpose is to destroy Strahd, not so much because it wants to free the land of Barovia from evil but because it wants revenge for the loss of its crystal blade. The weapon secretly fears its own destruction.

## Sword of Answering
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Weapon (longsword), legendary (requires attunement by a creature with the same alignment as the sword)*

In the world of Greyhawk, only nine of these blades are known to exist. Each is patterned after the legendary sword Fragarach, which is variously translated as "Final Word." Each of the nine swords has its own name and alignment, and each bears a different gem in its pommel.

|   Name    |   Alignment   |   Gem    |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| Answerer  | Chaotic good  | Emerald  |
|Back Talker| Chaotic evil  |   Jet    |
| Concluder |Lawful neutral | Amethyst |
| Last Quip |Chaotic neutral|Tourmaline|
| Rebutter  | Neutral good  |  Topaz   |
|  Replier  |    Neutral    | Peridot  |
| Retorter  |  Lawful good  |Aquamarine|
|  Scather  |  Lawful evil  |  Garnet  |
| Squelcher | Neutral evil  |  Spinel  |

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this sword. In addition, while you hold the sword, you can use your reaction to make one melee attack with it against any creature in your reach that deals damage to you. You have advantage on the attack roll, and any damage dealt with this special attack ignores any damage immunity or resistance the target has.

## Sword of the Planes
Source: The Book of Many Things

*Weapon (any sword), legendary (requires attunement)*

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic sword.

This sword can tear the fabric of reality, creating a temporary rift between planes. You can use your action to choose a different plane of existence from the one you’re on and slice through an unoccupied space within 5 feet of yourself, creating a rift to that other plane. The rift can be up to 10 feet high and 10 feet wide, and it lasts for 1 minute. Once this property is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

You can specify a target destination, such as the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire or the palace of Dispater on the second layer of the Nine Hells, and the rift opens in or near that destination (DM’s discretion). If you are trying to reach the City of Brass, for example, the rift might appear on the Street of Steel, before the Gate of Ashes, or facing the city from across the Sea of Fire, at the DM’s discretion.

Anything that enters the rift is instantly transported to the other plane, appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the rift.

## Tablet of Reawakening
Source: Dungeons and Dragons - Honor Among Thieves.

*Wondrous Item, legendary*

Witches of Rashemen created this Tiny stone tablet to counter the necromancy of the Red Wizards. As an action, you can cast [True Resurrection](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:true-resurrection) from the tablet. Once used in this way, the tablet turns to dust and is destroyed.

## Talarith
Source: Spelljammer: Adventures in Space - Boo's Astral Menagerie

*Wondrous item, Legendary (Usable Only by the Reigar Who Created It)*

The reigar who creates this piece of jewelry chooses its form: bracelet, brooch, diadem, or necklace. While the reigar wears the *talarith*, any weapon wielded by the reigar deals an extra 1d6 force damage when it hits.

As an action, a reigar can use its *talarith* to summon a golem that looks just like the reigar. The golem obeys the reigar's commands and uses the reigar's statistics, except it is a Construct that doesn't have a *talarith* of its own. The golem vanishes after 1 hour, or when it is reduced to 0 hit points. After summoning a golem, the reigar must finish a short or long rest before this property can be used again.

## Talisman of Pure Good
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a creature of good alignment)*

This talisman is a mighty symbol of goodness. A creature that is neither good nor evil in alignment takes 6d6 radiant damage upon touching the talisman. An evil creature takes 8d6 radiant damage upon touching the talisman. Either sort of creature takes the damage again each time it ends its turn holding or carrying the talisman.

If you are a good cleric or paladin, you can use the talisman as a holy symbol, and you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls while you wear or hold it.

The talisman has 7 charges. If you are wearing or holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge from it and choose one creature you can see on the ground within 120 feet of you. If the target is of evil alignment, a flaming fissure opens under it. The target must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or fall into the fissure and be destroyed, leaving no remains. The fissure then closes, leaving no trace of its existence. When you expend the last charge, the talisman disperses into motes of golden light and is destroyed.

When you make an Intelligence (Arcana) check to control a [Sphere of Annihilation](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:sphere-of-annihilation) while you are holding this talisman, you double your proficiency bonus on the check. In addition, when you start your turn with control over a [Sphere of Annihilation](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:sphere-of-annihilation), you can use an action to levitate it 10 feet plus a number of additional feet equal to 10 x your Intelligence modifier.

## Talisman of Ultimate Evil
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a creature of evil alignment)*

This item symbolizes unrepentant evil. A creature that is neither good nor evil in alignment takes 6d6 necrotic damage upon touching the talisman. A good creature takes 8d6 necrotic damage upon touching the talisman. Either sort of creature takes the damage again each time it ends its turn holding or carrying the talisman.

If you are an evil cleric or paladin, you can use the talisman as a holy symbol, and you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls while you wear or hold it.

The talisman has 6 charges. If you are wearing or holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge from the talisman and choose one creature you can see on the ground within 120 feet of you. If the target is of good alignment, a flaming fissure opens under it. The target must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or fall into the fissure and be destroyed, leaving no remains. The fissure then closes, leaving no trace of its existence. When you expend the last charge, the talisman dissolves into foul-smelling slime and is destroyed.

## Telescopic Transporter
Source: The Book of Many Things

*Wondrous Item, legendary*

This enormous telescope allows you to view distant celestial objects, including stars, Wildspace systems, and Astral Sea phenomena like the cities of deities or the petrified husks of dead gods.

After spending 1 hour calibrating the telescope, you can attempt to travel to the planet or celestial body at which the telescope is currently pointed. At the end of the hour, make a DC 17 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a successful check, you and eight other willing creatures touching the telescope, along with everything all travelers are wearing and carrying, safely teleport to unoccupied spaces at the intended destination. On a failed check, a mishap occurs instead. The DM rolls on the Telescope Travel Mishaps table to determine the mishap or chooses a mishap that’s good for the campaign.

## Tinderstrike
Source: Princes of the Apocalypse

*Weapon (dagger), legendary (requires attunement)*

A flint dagger, *Tinderstrike* is uncommonly sharp, and sparks cascade off its edge whenever it strikes something solid. Its handle is always warm to the touch, and the blade smolders for 1d4 minutes after it is used to deal damage. It contains a spark of Imix, Prince of Evil Fire.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls you make with this magic weapon. When you hit with it, the target takes an extra 2d6 fire damage.

***Fire Mastery.*** You gain the following benefits while you hold *Tinderstrike*:

* You can speak Ignan fluently.
* You have resistance to fire damage.
* You can cast [Dominate Monster](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:dominate-monster) (save DC 17) on a fire elemental. Once you have done so, *Tinderstrike* can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.

***Dance of the All-Consuming Fire.*** While inside a fire node, you can perform a ritual called the Dance of the All-Consuming Fire, using *Tinderstrike* to create a *devastation orb of fire* (see the [Devastation Orb](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:devastation-orb) description for the time and cost of the ritual). Once you perform the ritual, *Tinderstrike* can’t be used to perform the ritual again until the next dawn.

***Flaw.*** *Tinderstrike* makes its wielder impatient and rash. While attuned to the weapon, you gain the following flaw: “I act without thinking and take risks without weighing the consequences.”

## Tome of the Stilled Tongue
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a wizard)*

This thick leather-bound volume has a desiccated tongue pinned to the front cover. Five of these tomes exist, and it's unknown which one is the original. The grisly cover decoration on the first *tome of the stilled tongue* once belonged to a treacherous former servant of the lich-god Vecna, keeper of secrets. The tongues pinned to the covers of the four copies came from other spellcasters who crossed Vecna. The first few pages of each tome are filled with indecipherable scrawls. The remaining pages are blank and pristine.

If you can attune to this item, you can use it as a spellbook and an arcane focus. In addition, while holding the tome, you can use a bonus action to cast a spell you have written in this tome, without expending a spell slot or using any verbal or somatic components Once used, this property of the tome can't be used again until the next dawn.

While attuned to the book, you can remove the tongue from the book's cover. If you do so, all spells written in the book are permanently erased.

Vecna watches anyone using this tome. He can also write cryptic messages in the book. These messages appear at midnight and fade away after they are read.

## Topaz Annihilator
Source: Fizban's Treasury of Dragons

*Weapon (Firearm), Legendary (Requires Attunement)*

This magic ranged weapon resembles a musket, but in lieu of any ammunition, it holds a glowing yellow scale from a topaz dragon in its heart.

The weapon has a normal range of 100 feet and a long range of 300 feet, and it has the two-handed property. It deals 2d6 necrotic damage on a hit. If this damage reduces a creature or object to 0 hit points, the target is reduced to dust. A creature reduced to dust can be restored to life only by a true resurrection or wish spell.

While the weapon is on your person, you can use an action to cast the [Disintegrate](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:disintegrate) spell (save DC 18). Once this property is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

## Universal Solvent
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, legendary*

This tube holds milky liquid with a strong alcohol smell. You can use an action to pour the contents of the tube onto a surface within reach. The liquid instantly dissolves up to 1 square foot of adhesive it touches including [Sovereign Glue](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:sovereign-glue).

## Verminshroud
Source: Explorer's Guide to Wildemount

*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*

This patchy cloak was pieced together from the pelts of rats found feasting on the dead in Blightshore and is dotted with the bloated corpses of magically preserved insects along its seams.

***Dormant.*** While wearing the *Verminshroud* in its dormant state, you gain the following benefits:

* You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell, you are immune to disease, and you have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, wearing the cloak increases the range of your darkvision by 60 feet.
* As an action, you can use the verminshroud to cast [Polymorph](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:polymorph) on yourself, transforming into a **giant rat** or **rat** while retaining your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as the properties of the cloak. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.

***Awakened.*** While wearing the *Verminshroud* in its awakened state, you gain the following benefits:

* You have resistance to poison damage.
* You can use an action to cast the [Insect Plague](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:insect-plague) spell (save DC 15) from the *Verminshroud*, requiring no material components. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.
* When you cast the [Polymorph](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:polymorph) spell using the *Verminshroud*, you can transform into a **giant wasp**.

***Exalted.*** While wearing the *Verminshroud* in its exalted state, you gain the following benefits:

* You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.
* Your teeth become razor-sharp natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. You can make this attack as a bonus action. When you bite a creature and deal damage to it, the creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the condition on itself on a success.
* When you cast the [Polymorph](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:polymorph) spell using the *Verminshroud*, you can transform into a **giant scorpion**.

## Vorpal Sword
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Weapon (any sword that deals slashing damage), legendary (requires attunement)*

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, the weapon ignores resistance to slashing damage.

When you attack a creature that has at least one head with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, you cut off one of the creature's heads. The creature dies if it can't survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, doesn't have or need a head, has legendary actions, or the DM decides that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra 6d8 slashing damage from the hit.

## Wave
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Weapon (trident), legendary (requires attunement by a creature that worships a god of the sea)*

Held in the dungeon of White Plume Mountain, this trident is an exquisite weapon engraved with images of waves, shells, and sea creatures. Although you must worship a god of the sea to attune to this weapon, *Wave* happily accepts new converts.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. If you score a critical hit with it, the target takes extra necrotic damage equal to half its hit point maximum.

The weapon also functions as a [Trident of Fish Command](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:trident-of-fish-command) and a [Weapon of Warning](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:weapon-of-warning). It can confer the benefit of a [Cap of Water Breathing](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:cap-of-water-breathing) while you hold it, and you can use it as a [Cube of Force](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:cube-of-force) by choosing the effect, instead of pressing cube sides to select it.

**Sentience.** *Wave* is a sentient weapon of neutral alignment, with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Aquan. It can also speak with aquatic animals as if using a speak with animals spell, using telepathy to involve its wielder in the conversation.

**Personality.** When it grows restless, *Wave* has a habit of humming tunes that vary from sea chanteys to sacred hymns of the sea gods.

*Wave* zealously desires to convert mortals to the worship of one or more sea gods, or else to consign the faithless to death. Conflict arises if the wielder fails to further the weapon's objectives in the world.

The trident has a nostalgic attachment to the place where it was forged, a desolate island called Thunderforge. A sea god imprisoned a family of storm giants there, and the giants forged *Wave* in an act of devotion to — or rebellion against — that god.

*Wave* harbors a secret doubt about its own nature and purpose. For all its devotion to the sea gods, *Wave* fears that it was intended to bring about a particular sea god's demise. This destiny is something *Wave* might not be able to avert.

## Waythe
Source: Tales from the Yawning Portal

*Weapon (greatsword), legendary (requires attunement)*

*Waythe* is a unique greatsword most recently in the possession of a high-ranking cloud giant ambassador.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit a creature of the giant type with it, the giant takes an extra 2d6 slashing damage, and it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or fall prone.

The sword also functions as a [Wand of Enemy Detecetion](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:wand-of-enemy-detection). It regains all of its expended charges at dawn and isn't at risk of crumbling if its last charge is used.

***Sentience.*** *Waythe* is a sentient weapon of neutral good alignment, with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 2, and a Charisma of 14. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon can speak and understand Giant and Common, and it can communicate telepathically with its wielder.

***Personality.*** This sword believes in freedom and allowing others to live as they see fit. It is protective of its friends, and wants to be friends with a like-minded wielder. (It takes only 1 minute for a good-aligned character to gain attunement with the sword.) *Waythe* is courageous to the point of foolhardiness, however, and vocally urges bold action. It is likely to come into conflict with an evil or a timid wielder.

## Well of Many Worlds
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Wondrous item, legendary*

This fine black cloth, such as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.

You can use an action to unfold and place the *well of many worlds* on a solid surface, whereupon it creates a two-way portal to another world or plane of existence. Each time the item opens a portal, the DM decides where it leads. You can use an action to close an open portal by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Once *well of many worlds* has opened a portal, it can't do so again for 1d8 hours.

## Whelm
Source: Dungeon Master's Guide

*Weapon (warhammer), legendary (requires attunement by a dwarf)*

Whelm is a powerful warhammer forged by dwarves and lost in the dungeon of White Plume Mountain.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. At dawn the day after you first make an attack roll with *Whelm*, you develop a fear of being outdoors that persists as long as you remain attuned to the weapon. This causes you to have disadvantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks while you can see the daytime sky.

**Thrown Weapon.** *Whelm* has the thrown property, with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When you hit with a ranged weapon attack using it, the target takes an extra 1d8 bludgeoning damage, or an extra 2d8 bludgeoning damage if the target is a giant. Each time you throw the weapon, it flies back to your hand after the attack. If you don't have a hand free, the weapon lands at your feet.

**Shock Wave.** You can use an action to strike the ground with *Whelm* and send a shock wave out from the point of impact. Each creature of your choice on the ground within 60 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become stunned for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.

**Supernatural Awareness.** While you are holding the weapon, it alerts you to the location of any secret or concealed doors within 30 feet of you. In addition, you can use an action to cast [Detect Evil and Good](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:detect-evil-and-good) or [Locate Object](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:locate-object) object from the weapon. Once you cast either spell, you can't cast it from the weapon again until the next dawn.

**Sentience.** *Whelm* is a sentient lawful neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 15. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Dwarvish. Giant, and Goblin. It shouts battle cries in Dwarvish when used in combat.

**Personality.** *Whelm*'s purpose is to slaughter giants and goblinoids. It also seeks to protect dwarves against all enemies. Conflict arises if the wielder fails to destroy goblins and giants or to protect dwarves.

*Whelm* has ties to the dwarf clan that created it, variously called the Dankil or the Mightyhammer clan. It longs to be returned to that clan. It would do anything to protect those dwarves from harm.

The hammer also carries a secret shame. Centuries ago, a dwarf named Ctenmiir wielded it valiantly for a time. But Ctenmiir was turned into a vampire. His will was strong enough that he bent *Whelm* to his evil purposes, even killing members of his own clan.

## Windvane
Source: Princes of the Apocalypse

*Weapon (spear), legendary (requires attunement)*

A silver spear, *Windvane* has dark sapphires on the filigreed surface of its polished head. Held by its shining haft, the weapon feels insubstantial, as if clutching a cool, gently flowing breeze. The spear contains a spark of Yan-C-Bin, the Prince of Evil Air.

You have a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls you make with this magic weapon, which has the finesse weapon property. When you hit with it, the target takes an extra 1d6 lightning damage.

***Air Mastery.*** You gain the following benefits while you hold *Windvane*:

* You can speak Auran fluently.
* You have resistance to lightning damage.
* You can cast [Dominate Monster](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:dominate-monster) (save DC 17) on an air elemental. Once you have done so, *Windvane* can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.

***Song of the Four Winds.*** While inside an air node, you can perform a ritual called the Song of the Four Winds, using *Windvane* to create a *devastation orb of air* (see the [Devastation Orb](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:devastation-orb) description for the time and cost of the ritual). Once you perform the ritual, *Windvane* can’t be used to perform the ritual again until the next dawn.

***Flaw.*** *Windvane* makes its wielder mercurial and unreliable. While attuned to the weapon, you gain the following flaw: “I break my vows and plans. Duty and honor mean nothing to me.”

## Witchlight Vane
Source: The Wild Beyond The Witchlight

*Wondrous Item, Legendary (Requires Attunement by Mister Light or His Handpicked Successor)*

This ornate rod is topped by a pair of butterfly wings and incorporates bits of red glass into its length. It weighs 3 pounds.

**Magic Weapon.** In the hands of one who is attuned to it, the vane can be wielded as a magic mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. In addition, the vane deals an extra 1d8 radiant damage on a hit.

**Sense Mood.** While the vane is inside the perimeter of the Witchlight Carnival, it can sense the mood of every creature in the carnival that has an Intelligence of 4 or higher. As an action, a creature attuned to the vane can use it to pinpoint the location of the happiest creature in the carnival.

The butterfly shape at the top of the vane spins slowly clockwise when spirits in the carnival are generally high; if the general mood in the carnival is dour, the top of the vane spins slowly counterclockwise.

**Sentience.** The vane is a sentient, chaotic good wondrous item with an Intelligence of 11, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 14. It has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 30 feet, and it communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature attuned to it. Its purpose is to make sure everyone in the Witchlight Carnival is having a good time.

**Additional Properties.** The vane has the following additional properties:

* The creature holding the vane has vulnerability to lightning damage.
* The creature attuned to the vane can't be blinded, deafened, petrified, or stunned.
* While carrying the vane, the creature attuned to it can cast the [Dancing Lights](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:dancing-lights), [Polymorph](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:polymorph), or [Ray of Frost](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:ray-of-frost) spell as an action, requiring no spell components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability. After the vane's [Polymorph](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:polymorph) spell is cast, roll a d8; on a roll of 3 or 8, the vane can't be used to cast this spell again until the next dawn.

## Witchlight Watch
Source: The Wild Beyond The Witchlight

*Wondrous Item, Legendary (Requires Attunement by Mister Witch or His Handpicked Successor)*

This ornate pocket watch is fastened to the end of a gold chain. It glows with a faint golden light when opened, and it makes a soft ticking noise that can be heard only by the creature holding it. The face of the watch shows a miniature painting of the Witchlight Carnival ringed by a tiny henge, orbited at night by a mote of light small enough to slip through the eye of a needle. This light causes the henge to cast shadows, and these shadows allow the watch's owner to track the passage of time.

**Carnival Setup and Takedown.** The creature attuned to the watch can use an action to initiate the packing up or the unpacking of the Witchlight Carnival, provided the creature and the carnival are on the same plane of existence. In the span of 1 hour, all objects that are elements of the carnival are magically whisked about until everything is packed up and ready for travel, or unpacked and assembled. The watch has no effect on creatures, which can move about freely and safely while the carnival is being set up or taken down. Once the process of packing up or unpacking the carnival begins, it can't be stopped until the task is complete. When the watch is used to pack up or unpack the carnival, this property cannot be used again until 8 hours have elapsed.

**Additional Properties.** The pocket watch has the following additional properties:

* While carrying the watch, the creature attuned to it can cast the [Fire Bolt](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:fire-bolt), [Invisibility](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:invisibility), or [Message](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:message) spell as an action, requiring no spell components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability. After the watch's [Invisibility](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:invisibility) spell is cast, roll a d8; on a roll of 3 or 8, the watch can't be used to cast this spell again until the next dawn.
* The creature attuned to the watch gains 30 pounds. This extra weight vanishes when the attunement ends.
* The creature attuned to the watch must eat and drink eight times the normal amount each day.

## Wreath of the Prism
Source: Explorer's Guide to Wildemount

*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*

This loop of golden thorns is inset with dozens of gems representing the five colors of Tiamat.

***Dormant.*** While wearing the wreath in its dormant state, you have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, wearing the wreath increases the range of your darkvision by 60 feet.

When you hit a beast, dragon, or monstrosity of challenge rating 5 or lower with an attack, or when you grapple it, you can use the wreath to cast [Dominate Monster](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:dominate-monster) on the creature (save DC 13). On a successful save, the target is immune to the power of the wreath for 24 hours. On a failure, a shimmering, golden image of the wreath appears as a collar around the target's neck or as a crown on its head (your choice) until it is no longer charmed by the spell. If you use the wreath to charm a second creature, the first spell immediately ends. When the spell ends, the target knows it was charmed by you.

***Awakened.*** Once the *Wreath of the Prism* reaches an awakened state, it gains the following benefits:

* You can affect creatures of challenge rating 10 or lower with the wreath.
* The save DC of the wreath's spell increases to 15.

***Exalted.*** Once the *Wreath of the Prism* reaches an exalted state, it gains the following benefits:

* You can affect creatures of challenge rating 15 or lower with the wreath.
* The save DC of the wreath's spell increases to 17.

## Ythryn Mythallar
Source: Icewind Dale - Rime of the Frostmaiden

*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*

A *mythallar* looks like an enormous crystal ball held in an ornate cradle. The globe sheds bright light in a 300-foot radius and dim light for an additional 300 feet. The globe draws magic from the Weave that can be harnessed for various purposes. For example, Netherese mages used *mythallars* to keep their cities aloft and empower their magic items. The bigger the *mythallar*, the more magic it can hold. The largest *mythallars* are 150 feet in diameter.

The *Ythryn mythallar* is a relatively small device — a mere 50 feet in diameter. To attune to this *mythallar*, a creature must finish a short rest within 30 feet of it, meditating on the *mythallar*. Up to eight creatures can be attuned to it at one time; otherwise, the *Ythryn mythallar* follows the attunement rules in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*. If a ninth creature tries to attune to the *mythallar*, nothing happens.

All creatures attuned to the *Ythryn mythallar* can sense when the device is being used. A creature attuned to the device can use any of its properties, but only if all other creatures attuned to the device agree to allow it. The *Ythryn mythallar's* properties are as follows:

* While you're on the same plane of existence as the *Ythryn mythallar*, you can use an action to cause it to fly in any direction you choose at a speed of 30 feet. All matter within 500 feet of the device moves with it. The *Ythryn mythallar* and all structures held aloft by it hover in place when not in motion.
* As an action, you can cause one magic item you are holding within 30 feet of the *Ythryn mythallar* to immediately regain all its expended charges or uses. A magic item recharged in this manner can't be recharged by the *Ythryn mythallar* again until after the item regains expended charges or uses on its own.
* You can use the *Ythryn mythallar* to cast the [Control Weather](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:control-weather) spell without requiring any components and without the need for you to be outdoors. This casting of the spell has a 50-mile radius. For the duration of the spell's casting time, you must be within 30 feet of the *Ythryn mythallar* or the spell fails.

***Touching the Mythallar***. Any creature that touches the globe of the *mythallar* must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw, taking 180 (20d10 + 70) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Undead have disadvantage on this saving throw. Any object that touches the globe, other than an artifact or the *mythallar's* cradle, is disintegrated instantly (no save).
